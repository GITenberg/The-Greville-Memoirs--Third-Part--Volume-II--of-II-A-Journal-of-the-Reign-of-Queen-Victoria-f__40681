<p><i>January 1st</i>, 1856.&mdash;Intelligence arrived yesterday that Esterhazy had
presented the Austrian proposal to Nesselrode on the 28th, who had received it
<i>in profound silence</i>. Yesterday morning the 'Morning Post,' in communicating
this fact, put forth an article indecently violent and menacing against Prussia;
and as it contained a statement of what the Emperor Napoleon had said to Baron
Seebach, which was exactly what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> Persigny had told Clarendon, this alone would
prove, if any proof were required, that the article was inserted either by
Palmerston or by Persigny. The 'Morning Post' derives its only importance from
being the Gazette of Palmerston and of the French Government, and it is not very
easy to determine which of the two is guilty of this article. These are the sort
of manifestos which make us so odious all over the world.</p>


<div class="sidenote">MISCHIEVOUS RESULTS OF THE WAR.</div>

<p><i>Hatchford, January 2nd.</i>&mdash;The speech which Louis Napoleon addressed to the
Imperial Guard the day before yesterday when they marched into Paris in triumph,
gives reason for suspecting that the manifesto against Prussia in the 'Morning
Post' was French, for there is no small correspondence between the speech and
the article. In the article Prussia is openly threatened and told, if she will
not join the allies in making war on Russia, the allies will make war upon her;
in the speech the Guards are told to hold themselves in readiness and that a
great French army will be wanted. Nothing is more within the bounds of
probability than that the Emperor may determine, if he is obliged to make war,
to make it for a French object, and on some enemy from whom a good spoil may be
taken, a war which will gratify French vanity and cupidity, and which will
therefore not be unpopular. He may think, and most probably not erroneously,
that in the present temper of this country the people would be quite willing to
let him do what he pleases with Prussia, Belgium, or any other part of the
continent, if he will only concur with us in making fierce war against Russia.
But though this I believe to be the feeling of the masses, and that their
resentment against Prussia is so strong that they would rejoice at seeing
another Jena followed by similar results, the minority who are elevated enough
in life to reason and reflect will by no means like to see France beginning to
run riot again, and while we have been making such an uproar about the temporary
occupation of the Principalities and the crossing of the Pruth by Russia, that
we should quietly consent to, nay, become accomplices in the passage of the
Rhine and an aggression on Germany by France. The very possibility of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
shows the necessity of putting an end to a war which cannot continue without so
many and such perilous contingencies. Nothing in fact can exceed the
complications in which we can hardly help being plunged, and the various
antagonistic interests which will be brought into collision, creating
perplexities and difficulties which it would require the genius of a Richelieu
to unravel and compose. The earth under our feet may be mined with plots; we
know not what any of the Great Powers are really designing; the only certainty
for us is that we are going on blindly and obstinately spending our wealth and
our blood in a war in which we have no interest, and in keeping Europe in a
state of ferment and uncertainty the ultimate consequences of which it is
appalling to contemplate. Clarendon showed me a letter from Francis Baring from
Paris the other day, which told him that the Emperor wished to make peace,
because he knew that France, with all her outward signs of prosperity, was
unable to go on with the war without extreme danger, that she is in fact 'using
herself up,' has been going on at a rate she cannot afford.</p>


<div class="sidenote">NEGOTIATIONS FOR PEACE.</div>

<p><i>Hatchford, January 4th.</i>&mdash;I was in London yesterday, where I saw George Lewis,
who was very low, sees no chance of peace, and everybody thinks it hopeless
since the Russian Circular has appeared. It is difficult to understand the
motive of the Russians in publishing such a proposal, when they must know it
would not and could not be accepted, and were also aware of the terms the
Western Powers were going to offer to her. Lewis says our financial prospect is
very bad, a declining revenue, rising prices, a large loan wanted which will be
got on bad terms, and more money to be lent to Sardinia and Turkey. He thinks,
if the Russians propose to negotiate, that Palmerston will never consent; but
though he will no doubt resist, if France presses it I have no doubt he will
give way and that the majority of the Cabinet will be for doing so. Everything
looks as black as possible, and the Emperor Napoleon's speech to the Imperial
Guard following Persigny's article in the 'Morning Post' wears a very menacing
aspect. It is possible indeed that he may have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> held this language in order to
frighten us into a more pacific disposition, but so far from being alarming or
unpalatable to the majority here, they will hail with satisfaction any
intimation of his resolution to make war on Prussia; and if Louis Napoleon will
only go on fighting against Russia, they will be quite willing that he should
take whatever he pleases from any other power which will not join us in our
present crusade. I often wonder what the Duke of Wellington would have said and
thought if he could have lived to see this day, and the madness of this nation.</p>


<p><i>London, January 9th.</i>&mdash;I came to town on Monday and found when I arrived that
there was a fresh glimmering of peace. Austria had sent word she was inclined to
believe that Russia intended to accept the terms. I went to Lewis, who told me
this was true, but he did not know on what ground their opinion rested more than
that ten days had elapsed during which no symptoms of a flat refusal had
appeared, and Lewis himself thought there was no doubt they were considering
whether they should accept or what reply they should make. Colloredo called on
Clarendon the other day, and, after some unimportant talk, asked him if he had
ever heard, or had reason to believe, that Russia had made a communication to
France to the effect that if France had a mind to take the Rhenish Provinces and
make peace with her, she should not oppose such a design. Clarendon replied that
he knew nothing of it, but thought it not at all improbable.</p>

<p>Bernstorff had a conversation with Reeve the other day in which he told him that
he was much put out at the isolated condition of Prussia, and gave him to
understand that he should like the King to join the alliance, but he did not
think anything would induce him to do so. It might perhaps be prudent, but it
would be enormously base if Prussia were to come <i>au secours des vainqueurs</i>,
and, now that Russia is in exceeding distress, to join England and France, to
whom she certainly is under no obligations, in crushing her. But then it would
only be prudent for the moment and to remove an immediate and impending danger,
for in the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> comprehensive view of the balance of power and with referance
to general policy, it would be far wiser to leave the power of Russia
undiminished. Germany has nothing to fear from Russia, for the notion of her
being eternally animated with designs of conquest in every direction is a mere
chimï¿½ra which the people who propagate it do not themselves believe. The part
she has played for many years past has been that of a pacificator, and her only
intervention has been to appease quarrels, and resist the progress of democracy
and revolution. In 1848 it was the authority of the Emperor Nicholas which
prevented a great war between Austria and Prussia which would have made all
Germany a scene of havoc and bloodshed. Our Government now evidently expect a
proposal from Russia to negotiate, and are living in hopes that it may be
rejected <i>in limine</i> by Esterhazy, and that they shall be able to prevail on the
Emperor Napoleon not to consent to any overture that may be made to him through
any other channel.</p>


<p><i>January 15th</i>.&mdash;I came to town yesterday morning and found on my arrival the
Russian answer, which was pretty much what I expected. I suspect our Government
will have been disappointed that so much was conceded as to make a peremptory
rejection so monstrous as to be hardly safe. However, Esterhazy has been ordered
to withdraw on the 18th, unless everything else is conceded. Granville fancies
they are not unlikely to do this, but I am persuaded they will not. It remains
to be seen what the French will do, for all depends on them. I asked Granville
what he thought would be the end of it; he said <i>on the whole</i> he was rather
disposed to expect it would lead to peace; he said Austria did not mean to go to
war with Russia in any case, he thought she had played her cards with
considerable dexterity, and made herself a sort of arbitress, and, what she most
desired, had got a decided lead of Prussia, the object of her hatred. I asked
him if Prussia was terrified at the menaces contained in the Emperor's speech
and other things against her, and he said he thought she was irritated but not
frightened, and he inveighed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> against the folly of such, speeches, and
especially such articles as Persigny, if it was he, had put into the 'Morning
Post.'</p>


<p><i>January 16th.</i>&mdash;So far as I can as yet discover of public opinion, it is in
favour of accepting, or at all events of negotiating on, the Russian proposals.
The 'Times' has an ambiguous article on the subject. Nobody will approve of the
continuation of the war merely to obtain an Austrian object, which the cession
of Bessarabia is, and the article about Bomarsund, which has nothing to do with
the avowed object of the war. I have not the least doubt one half of the
Cabinet, at least, are in their hearts of this opinion, but I am afraid they
will not have the courage to stand forth, avow, and act upon it.</p>


<div class="sidenote">TERMS OF PEACE ACCEPTED BY RUSSIA.</div>

<p><i>January 17th.</i>&mdash;I saw Lewis yesterday and for the first time saw something
approaching to <i>a certainty</i> of peace. His information was curious: the 'Morning
Post,' in the statement inserted by Persigny, said that the Russians had
rejected the conditions about Bessarabia, and about Bomarsund and had accepted
the rest. In the counter proposition of Russia there was no mention of
Bomarsund, and for this very good reason, that no such proposal was made to
them. When the terms of Austria and France were sent here our Government
objected to that article which said the allies reserved to themselves to make
<i>other</i> conditions, or some such words. They said it was not fair, and that they
should at once say what they wanted, and <i>all</i> they wanted, and the additions
they proposed were that Bomarsund should not be restored, that Consuls should be
admitted to the Black Sea ports, and that 'something' should be done about
Georgia and Circassia. This was their answer, and our allies agreed to these
additions, but for what reason has not as yet appeared. They sent the terms to
St. Petersburg in their original shape and without our articles, so that in fact
no condition about Bomarsund was made to them. The Cabinet met yesterday to
determine what answer should be sent to Paris, the French having notified that
they would make no reply to the counter proposal till they were apprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> of our
sentiments thereupon. Lewis said he had no doubt that both governments would be
willing to enter upon negotiation on these terms, France and Austria being
anxious for peace and our Government not averse, for they begin to perceive that
there is a rapidly increasing disposition to put an end to the war, and
particularly that nobody will desire to continue it merely to obtain an
exclusively Austrian object, which the cession of part of Bessarabia would be,
especially as Austria has no thought of going to war. The Russian Government
have written in a very conciliatory tone to Paris, which is known, though the
letter has not yet arrived. The King of Prussia had written a private, but very
pressing letter to the Emperor of Russia entreating him to make peace. Though
very private, the French Government contrived to get a copy of it, and Cowley
sent this copy home. It is said to be a very able letter written in a most
confidential style. Such being the state of affairs and all parties apparently
being agreed in a disposition to put an end to the war, it seemed to me quite
certain that the negotiations would be established, and that they would lead to
peace. In the evening I asked Granville if he did not think we should now
certainly have peace, and he said 'I think so, but there are still a great many
complications,' and he said Cowley and Walewski were on such bad terms that they
hardly spoke. The fact is that Cowley is a gentleman and a man of honour and
veracity, but he is sensitive and prone to take offence; the other is an
adventurer, a needy speculator, without honour, conscience, or truth, and
utterly unfit both as to his character and his capacity for such an office as he
holds. Then it must be owned that it must be intolerably provoking to Walewski
or any man in his situation to see Cowley established in such strange relations
with the Emperor, being at least for certain purposes more his Minister for
Foreign Affairs than Walewski himself.</p>


<p><i>12 o'clock.</i>&mdash;Payne has just rushed in here, to say that a telegraphic message,
dated Vienna, ten o'clock last night, announces that 'Russia accepts
<i>unconditionally</i> the proposals of the allies.' The consequence of this
astounding intelli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>gence was such a state of confusion and excitement on the
Stock Exchange as was hardly ever seen before. The newspapers had one and all
gone on predicting that the negotiations would lead to nothing, and that the war
would go on, so that innumerable people continued to be 'bears,' and they were
all rushing to get out as fast as they could. It remains yet to be seen whether
it is really true; if it is, the Russians will be prodigiously provoked when
they find that this concession was superfluous, and that the allies would have
accepted <i>their</i> terms.</p>


<p><i>January 18th.</i>&mdash;Though the account in the 'Times' was not exactly correct, it
proved substantially so. The right message came from Seymour soon after. There
was such a scene in the Stock Exchange as was hardly ever witnessed; the funds
rose three per cent., making five in the last two days. The Rothschilds, and all
the French who were in the secret with Walewski, must have made untold sums. I
have been endeavouring to account for what appears the extraordinary conduct of
Russia in accepting the Austrian terms purely and simply, and this strikes me to
be the solution of it, and if my idea is correct it will account for the
exceedingly bad terms which Cowley and Walewski are on. The conditions offered
to Russia contained none of the points insisted on by our Government. I believe
that the French and Austrians believed, very likely were certain, that if they
had been sent Russia would have refused them, and, being bent on peace, they
resolved to leave them out, and excuse themselves to England as they best could;
they therefore simply presented their proposal as it originally stood. Russia
replied with a qualified acceptance, and then Esterhazy was obliged by the
compact to say that he could only take yes or no; then, finding them not
inclined to give any other answer, that he or somebody else told them the true
state of the case, viz., that he had kept back the conditions <i>we</i> had demanded,
and that unless they accepted his proposition, it must of necessity fall to the
ground, and that nothing would then prevent the English points being brought
forward and made absolute conditions of any fresh preliminaries. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> very
likely to determine them to accept the proposals as put before them, for
although by so doing they accepted the fifth condition, which exposes them to
further and not specified demands, the especial points on which we insist can
only be brought forward as points for negotiation, and will not form part of
those conditions to which by their acceptance they stand completely and
irrevocably pledged.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POPULAR FEELING FOR WAR.</div>

<p><i>London, January 22nd.</i>&mdash;I went to Trentham on Friday, and returned yesterday.
Granville is very confident of peace, fancying that Russia will make no
difficulties, and will agree to our additional demands, which may be so, but
seems to me far from certain. The intelligence of peace being at hand, or
probable, gives no satisfaction here, and the whole press is violent against it,
and thunders away against Russia and Austria, warns the people not to expect
peace, and incites them to go on with the war. There seems little occasion for
this, for the press has succeeded in inoculating the public with such an eager
desire for war that there appears a general regret at the notion of making
peace. When I was at Trentham, I asked Mr. Fleming, the gardener, a very
intelligent man, what the general feeling was in that part of the world, and he
said the general inclination was to go on with the war till we had made Russia,
besides other concessions, pay all its expenses. It appears to me impossible the
<i>entente cordiale</i> with France can go on long if the war goes on, when the
people here are passionate for war, and in France they are equally passionate
for peace. If the Emperor goes on with the war he will be very popular here,
which does not signify much to him, but give deep offence to his own countrymen,
which will be of vital importance to him, and no wonder, for their disgust will
be intense at being compelled to carry on a war at a ruinous expense, merely
because it is the pleasure of the English to do so. This seems so obvious that I
do not believe, after having gone so far, and excited such strong hopes of
peace, that he will dare to disappoint the expectations of the country. What the
people of England would really like would be to engage France to continue, and
to issue a joint declaration of war against Austria and Prussia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>


<p><i>January 23rd.</i>&mdash;Telegraphic news yesterday that Austria positively refuses to
send our supplementary conditions to St. Petersburg. France backed us up, or at
least pretended to do so, for it is quite impossible to know what she really
does. Baudin is come over here, supposed to be for the purpose of explaining and
apologising for Walewski's not having sent the conditions originally. I do not
know what excuse he makes. Lewis thinks as I do, that the real reason was his
fear lest they should endanger the acceptance by Russia of the conditions. Our
Government believe, or at least pretend to do so, that the Emperor was innocent
of this <i>ruse</i> and that Walewski is alone guilty; but I doubt it, for I cannot
believe Walewski would dare to do such a thing without his master's knowledge
and consent, and should not be surprised if the whole thing was the Emperor's
doing.</p>

<p>There is a tremendous clamour got up by the press against Lord Stratford on
account of his neglect of General Williams at Kars and leaving his appeals for
aid unattended to. Stratford has sent home a defence of himself, and, I hear, a
skilful one. I do not think they will remove him, because they say he is now
acting <i>bonï¿½ fide</i> according to his instructions, and exerting all his influence
to smooth any difficulties that may arise at Constantinople in adjusting the
terms of peace. But it is likely that the Turks are now very anxious for peace,
as they are exceedingly sick of their protectors, by whom their dignity and
independence are quite as much compromised as by their enemies, while the
process of exhaustion is going on at a constantly increasing ratio.</p>


<div class="sidenote">LORD DERBY AND MR. DISRAELI.</div>

<p><i>January 26th.</i>&mdash;Yesterday morning Disraeli called on me, and after we had
discussed some private affairs, he began talking politics. He is very triumphant
at his pacific views and expectations having turned out so true, and at the
'Press' newspaper having proved to be right. He said, he had never stood so well
with the <i>best</i> men of his party as he did now, that he is to have forty-five
men, the cream of the Conservatives, to dine with him on Wednesday next. He then
talked of Derby and the blunders he had made in spite of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> the advice he had
given and the remonstrances he had made to him, that he had written to him and
told him what he knew from undoubted authority must and would happen about
peace, and implored him not to commit himself to the continuance of the war, but
that Derby with all his great talents had no discretion, and suffered himself to
be led and influenced by some of the weakest and least capable men of his party.
So instead of listening to what Disraeli said to him, he writes a long, reasoned
reply to his arguments in the same way he would have replied to a speech in the
House of Lords, and when he went to Scotland he had the folly to go to some
meeting got up for the purpose, and then to make a violent war speech. I asked
him how Derby and Stanley got on together, and he said that they were so much
attached to each other, and Stanley had so profound a filial veneration for his
father, that personal feelings silenced all political differences, and nothing
would induce Stanley to take any public part adverse to his father's policy and
opinions. It was evident that there is little political cordiality between Derby
and Disraeli, and a considerable split in the party. If Disraeli is to be
believed, the best of the Conservatives are disposed to go with him rather than
with Derby, but I own I much doubt this. However, it will soon be seen what the
state of that party is.</p>

<p>No further advance has been made towards the arrangements, but it is clear peace
will be made. George Grey told me so yesterday, and intimated as much as that
small difficulties must and would be got over. France, Austria, and Russia are
resolved on peace, and England cannot alone make herself an obstacle. I suppose
it will end in some compromise upon the points remaining in dispute.</p>

<p>Macaulay has retired from Parliament, where he had done nothing since his last
election; he hardly ever attended and never spoke, or certainly not more than
once. It is to be hoped his life will be spared to bring down his history to the
end of Queen Anne's reign, which is all that can possibly be expected.</p>


<p><i>January 31st.</i>&mdash;Parliament meets to-day. Who would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> have thought a few weeks
ago that the Queen's Speech would announce the preliminaries of peace? Who would
ever have thought that tidings of peace would produce a general sentiment of
disappointment and dissatisfaction in this nation? There are, however, sundry
symptoms of an approaching change in the public mind. The press is much
perplexed; the newspapers do not know what to say. They confidently predicted
that there would be no peace, and urged the people to go on clamouring for war
as long as they could; but since they have seen that their noise is ineffectual,
and that peace is inevitable, they have nearly left off inveighing against it,
because doing so without any result only exhibits their own impotence, which is
just what they most wish to avoid. They therefore now confine themselves to a
sort of undergrowl, muttering abuse against Russia and Austria, calling out for
more stringent terms, and still indulging in a desperate hope that some
unexpected difficulty may occur to break off the negotiations and plunge us into
war again. The Opposition are as much perplexed as the press, and do not know
what course to take, or what is the most vulnerable part of the Government, and
they are not agreed among themselves.</p>

<p>So in the meantime they seem disposed to vent themselves in a fierce attack on
Baron Parke's Life Peerage. This peerage has excited great wrath even in many
who are friendly to the Government, and probably in all who are unfriendly.
Amongst those who most vehemently resent it are Lord Campbell, Lord Lyndhurst,
and, as I am told, Brougham. There is much to be said about it either way, and
it will probably give rise to some good debates and not uninteresting.</p>

<p>As one of many other proofs of the difficulty of getting at truth, and therefore
of having history correctly written, I must record a fact not very important in
itself. Lewis distinctly told me that it was <i>France</i> (i.e. Walewski) who kept
back our conditions when the Austrian propositions were returned to Vienna; now
Granville tells me it was not France, but Austria, who is responsible for their
not having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> been sent to St. Petersburg, and that Walewski did send them to
Vienna. The truth probably is that he gave notice to Buol that we wanted these
things, but did not incorporate them with the propositions, and that Buol,
though apprised of them, did not choose to insert what France had not chosen to
insert herself. It is quite impossible to believe that they can make any serious
difficulty; it is time to make peace with Russia when our relations with America
are assuming a very unpleasant aspect.</p>


<div class="sidenote">MEETING OF PARLIAMENT.</div>

<p><i>February 3rd.</i>&mdash;Parliament opened very quietly, and there was no disposition
evinced to find fault with the Government, or to throw obstacles in the way of
making peace. A great change has certainly come over the country within the last
fortnight or three weeks, not that people are not still sorry to see the end of
the war, and rather inclined to view the peace with suspicion as well as
dislike, but they have no grounds for complaint, they see that it is inevitable,
and they are disposed to acquiesce.</p>

<p>Derby came down full of opposition but rather puzzled how to vent it, so he
criticised the Speech, which was a very poor and bald composition, made a great
stir about Kars, and announced a fierce attack on Baron Parke's Life Peerage.</p>

<p>In the House of Commons everything was very <i>piano</i>, and Disraeli quite
moderate. The Government are much puzzled about this unlucky Life Peerage. The
thing is done, and now they find themselves condemned by a large majority which
includes all the Law Peers. If any vote can be taken on it in the House of
Lords, they will be beaten.</p>

<p>The Conferences will begin in about three weeks, and probably be very soon over,
for it is the object of all parties to put an end to the enormous expense which,
every day that the war lasts, is increased, and no doubt is entertained by the
well-informed that Russia is in earnest, and will go through with it firmly and
sincerely. The most unpleasant incident is the difference with America, which
has a bad aspect, but when they learn that we are going to make peace with
Russia we flatter ourselves the Americans will become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> reasonable.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> If a war
should ensue it would be still more insane than the Russian war, for we should
be fighting absolutely for no object whatever, and merely from the collision of
the proud and angry feelings of the two nations. Neither would gain anything if
the other were to give way and concede all that is in dispute as to the Central
American question.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [Differences had arisen between the British and the American
Governments in consequence of the enlistment of American citizens in the British
army during the war, and also with reference to the British possessions in
Central America.]</p></div>


<p><i>February 7th.</i>&mdash;Nothing can be more extraordinary than the lull here, after so
much sound and fury, while the negotiations and question of peace or war are
pending. There is evidently a complete acquiescence in the coming peace, though
if the terms are not as stringent as people expect, there will be a great deal
of grumbling and abuse of the Government.</p>

<p>The case with America looks bad, but nobody can seriously believe that war
between the two countries can possibly arise out of such questions as those now
pending. It will probably end in the return of Crampton, and the return of
Buchanan, suspension of diplomatic relations for a time, then fresh negotiations
and a reconciliation, but no war.</p>


<div class="sidenote">THE LIFE PEERAGE QUESTION.</div>

<p><i>February 9th.</i>&mdash;The debate in the House of Lords on the Wensleydale Peerage was
interesting but inconclusive. Lyndhurst made, as usual, a wonderful speech for
his age. He contrived with much dexterity to avoid the question of legality,
which he evidently thought he could not disprove; Campbell and St. Leonards
boldly pronounced it illegal; Brougham admitted the legality; all the lawyers
but the Chancellor are dead against the Life Peerage. Out of the House,
Lushington is clear for it; Pemberton Leigh against; both of them have been
offered and have refused peerages. The result appears to be that the patent is
not illegal, but that there was no sufficient cause, and therefore that it was a
great folly to deviate from the usual course in Parke's case. It is awkward, and
both the Opposi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>tion and the Government seem very much puzzled what to do. The
best course on the whole seems to be (and it probably will so end) to confer on
the Baron an hereditary peerage, and let the question of life peers stand over
for the present, to be better considered and discussed hereafter when
circumstances may require such a measure.</p>

<p>Palmerston made a very good speech last night on the American questions,
judicious and becoming, and it was very well received. According to present
appearances the Government is in no danger of being turned out, and if they make
a peace which satisfies, and bring in and pass some good measures, they may
actually become strong.</p>


<p><i>February 15th.</i>&mdash;While the world is waiting with tolerable patience for the
opening of the negotiations, it has got two subjects to occupy and interest it,
and to give rise to plenty of discussion and dispute. The first is the Life
Peerage question, which is become very embarrassing to its opponents and its
advocates. There is a great majority of the lawyers against it, but more on the
score of its being improper and inexpedient, <i>perhaps</i> unconstitutional, than
that it is absolutely illegal. The highest authority in favour of it seems to be
Dr. Lushington, who refused to be made a peer when a peerage was pressed upon
him. The Government are determined to fight it out, and on no account to give
way. Nobody knows with whom the project originated, but there is a very general
idea that it was with the Prince. General Grey, however, told his brother, the
Earl, that the Prince had nothing to do with it, and that His Royal Highness
knew nothing of the matter till after it had been settled. I cannot see how it
can be <i>illegal</i>, and neither the danger nor the inexpediency of making Life
Peers is quite apparent to me; but I think it has been a blunder, and that so
great a novelty ought not to have been suddenly sprung upon the world without
any attempt to ascertain how it would be regarded, and Derby's argument it is
very difficult to meet. He says that when a certain prerogative has not been
exercised for 400 years, such long disuse of it, if it does not amount to an
abrogation of it, at all events throws such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> doubt upon it as to make the
exercise of it now exceedingly questionable, and it appears by the precedents
that in every case of a Life Peerage it was done <i>consensu procerum</i>, or
<i>consensu procerum et communitatis</i>, that is, by consent of the Lords, or by Act
of Parliament. The whole question is so obscure and uncertain, that it is
impossible to come to any satisfactory conclusion drawn from precedents and
usage. In spite of the resolution of the Government, I doubt whether they will
not be compelled to give way in some manner, for the Opposition appear to be
equally resolved not to let Baron Parke take his seat.</p>

<p>The other subject is Sir John McNeill's report,<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which has already elicited
violent articles in the papers, and will occasion hot debates in the House of
Commons, perhaps in both Houses. The report furnishes a strong <i>primï¿½ facie</i>
case against Airey and Gordon, Q.M. and A.Q.M. Generals, and <i>par ricochet</i>
against Hardinge himself, also against Lucan and Cardigan. The accused parties
vehemently complain, and insist upon being allowed to vindicate themselves.
Probably in the course of the discussions a good deal of the truth, but not all,
will come out. It may be doubted whether there is any part of our military
administration, as well as of our military operations during this war, on which
it is possible to reveal and explain everything without showing up the French,
and this has been the reason why all investigations and explanations have had
such imperfect and unsatisfactory results. If the charges of McNeill are true,
it seems to me that the man most to blame was Raglan, who was supreme,
omnipotent, and responsible, and who ought not to have allowed the evils, which
were notorious, to go on accumulating, without applying those effectual remedies
which, according to the report, were abundantly at his disposal; but of course
everybody will shrink from casting the blame posthumously upon him. The 'Times'
has now found that the losses and sufferings of the army were erroneously and
wrongfully attributed to the Government at home. McNeill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> has brought back with
him notes of conversations with Raglan, in which Raglan told him that most if
not all of the things he had been so bitterly reproached for were all owing to
the opposition and contradiction he met with from the French, Canrobert
especially.</p>

</div>

<p>Cowley, who called on me the day before yesterday, said he should be very glad
to have peace concluded, in order that our intimate connexion and dependence on
each other might be at an end, for the difficulties arising therefrom, and the
impossibility of placing any reliance on the French Ministers, were a perpetual
source of annoyance. He thinks the Emperor honest and true, but that he is
surrounded by a parcel of men every one of whom is dishonest and false. The
Emperor knows this, and knows what is thought of his ministers, but he says
'What am I to do? and where can I find better men who will enter my service?'</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CONFERENCE IN PARIS.</div>

<p>Clarendon came here to-day to take leave of me on going to the Conference in
Paris. He talks despondingly, but less about making peace than about making one
that will be acceptable here. He augurs well from the choice of Russian
Plenipotentiaries who are both personally agreeable to him, for he knows Orloff
very intimately. When he took leave of Brunnow three years ago he said to him,
'If ever you see a good chance of peace, let me know,' and now Brunnow has sent
him a message reminding him of what he had said, and telling him he now saw it.
It was Clarendon who fixed on Paris for the Conference, everybody else being
against it, especially the Emperor Napoleon and Palmerston, but Clarendon
thought the advantage of having personal communication with the Emperor himself
outweighed every other consideration, and he is right. Louis Napoleon will be
the arbiter, and the struggle will be between England and Russia to get
possession of him. Brunnow arrived at Paris to-day, the first arrival of the
Plenipotentiaries, and he was received with great acclamations and
manifestations of joy. Clarendon is dissatisfied at Brunnow's having got there
first as if to steal a march on him, but this is unreasonable, as no particular
day was fixed for their coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> at once, and Clarendon might have been the first
if he had chosen it, and Cavour is to be there to-day or to-morrow.</p>



<p><i>February 21st.</i>&mdash;A week has passed since most of the Plenipotentiaries arrived
at Paris, and we hear nothing of what has been going on amongst them; at least I
hear nothing except that Clarendon writes word he is quite satisfied with the
Emperor&mdash;the Hollands, that all sorts of intrigues are rife, Brunnow, Morny, and
Madame de Lieven closeted together for hours, and Madame de Lieven writes to me
in melancholy mood, saying she anticipates many difficulties, and complaining of
the <i>exigeances</i> which she hears of as probable, and how ungenerous as well as
impolitic it is to make no allowance for the difficulty of the Emperor's
position <i>vis ï¿½ vis</i> of his own people, and to bear so hard upon him. From all
this I infer that the Russians have been informed that the Emperor Napoleon has
engaged to back us up in our <i>exigeances</i>, the principal of which is probably
the dismantling of Nicolaieff; this may be inferred from what has appeared in
the French press. The 'Journal des Dï¿½bats' published an article saying we had no
right to demand this, to which the 'Siï¿½cle' replied asserting we had a right,
and the article in the 'Siï¿½cle' was copied into the 'Moniteur,' which was
tantamount to a recognition and approval of it. There are rumours afloat here
that matters are not going on satisfactorily at Paris, and, taking all these
things together, it looks as if the horizon was a little overcast, but as Orloff
was only to arrive at Paris last night nothing essential can as yet have passed.
Meanwhile this country remains in the same passive and expectant state, so far
behaving very well that there is not the least stir or any attempt to make peace
more difficult, not a word said in Parliament, no meetings or petitions, the
'Times' nearly silent, and only an undergrowl from time to time from the Radical
or malignant journals. But all who have had any opportunity of testing the state
of public feeling agree that the peace, be it what it may, will be taken with
regret, and that if Clarendon were to return having broken off the negotiations,
and to announce that the war would go on, he would be hailed with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> greatest
enthusiasm, and the ardour for war would break out with redoubled force.</p>

<p>While this lull has been going on upon the great question, the world has been
less passionately moved and interested by the affair of the Wensleydale Peerage,
and nobody has talked of anything else for the last ten days but this and the
Crimean Report. The general feeling amongst the lawyers and in society is
against the Life Peerage, but the Government are very reluctant to give way and
to own themselves beaten upon it. To-night is the great, and, it may be hoped,
final struggle in the House of Lords upon it, when nobody doubts that the
Government will be beaten.</p>

<p>Last night the Evangelical and Sabbatarian interest had a great victory in the
House of Commons, routing those who endeavoured to effect the opening of the
National Gallery and British Museum on Sunday. The only man of importance who
sustained this unequal and imprudent contest was Lord Stanley. At this moment
cant and Puritanism are in the ascendant, and so far from effecting any
anti-sabbatarian reform, it will be very well if we escape some of the more
stringent measures against Sunday occupations and amusements with which Exeter
Hall and the prevailing spirit threaten us.</p>


<div class="sidenote">LORD CLARENDON IN PARIS.</div>

<p><i>February 24th.</i>&mdash;A letter from Lady Clarendon, who says 'the report about
things going ill is false, and as yet things have hardly begun. The Emperor in
feelings and opinions is everything that Clarendon could desire.' Madame de
Lieven received Clarendon <i>ï¿½ bras ouverts</i>, but said very little to him. This
morning I called on George Lewis, and had a long talk about the prospects of
peace. He said Palmerston, according to his ancient custom, was doing all he
could to extort as much as possible from Russia, writing to Clarendon in this
strain constantly and urging him to insist on more and more concessions; but
Lewis thinks notwithstanding this that Palmerston has quite made up his mind for
peace, and that he makes demands very often with the expectation of being
refused, and the intention of not insisting on them if he finds a very
determined resistance. One point of difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> is Kars; the Russians not
unfairly wish to have some equivalent for surrendering it, and Palmerston
insists that they are not entitled to any. In the preliminaries it was settled
that we were to restore all our conquests, and they were in return to give up
part of Bessarabia. At that time Kars was not taken, and now they say the
relative positions of the parties are altered, and 'if we are to restore Kars,
that ought to be set against the restoration of Kinburn, the part of the Crimea
you occupy, &amp;c., and having got an equivalent in Kars, you ought to relax your
demand for Bessarabia.' To this Palmerston replies that the Russians are to
guarantee the integrity of the Turkish dominions, of which Kars is a part, and
therefore their restoration of it is a matter of course for which no equivalent
is necessary. This argument is not logical, and no arbitrator would admit it. It
is a good point to wrangle upon, and if the Russians knock under it will be
because they are resolved to submit to any terms rather than not have peace.</p>

<p>It is much the same thing about Nicolaieff, as to which the Emperor appears at
present disposed to back us up. Lewis disapproves of our <i>exigeances</i> and
Palmerston's tone. He thinks on both points the Russians have good cases, and
that Palmerston and Clarendon are only fighting for them in order to have a more
plausible and showy peace to set before the country. He says we never thought of
demanding the destruction of the docks of Nicolaieff <i>at first</i>, and that our
demanding it now is a mere afterthought, and in pursuance of the plan of
starting as many demands as we can to take the chance of what we can get. Lewis
disapproves of this course, and urged me to encourage Clarendon not to lend
himself to exigencies unjust in themselves, but to do what he really thinks
right and necessary without fear of the consequences.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEBATE ON LIFE PEERAGES.</div>

<p>When we had done talking of this matter he said he wanted to speak to me about
the Peerage question, which had assumed a shape which he thought menaced great
embarrassment, if not danger. The Government, he said, would not give way, and
he was himself opposed to their doing so; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> what was to be done? I said I did
not see what the Government could do, nor why they should not give way when they
had resolved to fight and had been fairly beaten; but he thought they should
stultify themselves by acknowledging they had been wrong, and that such a course
would oblige the Chancellor to resign. I controverted these propositions and
said they would stultify themselves much more, if from motives of vanity and
pride they chose to let the House of Lords remain without that assistance to
obtain which was the pretext for Parke's creation. On the whole, Lewis seemed to
think the least objectionable course would be to pass a bill enabling the Crown
to make a certain number of Life Peers, but he overlooked the fact that this
would be as much a confession of error, and an acknowledgement that the Queen
had no such prerogative, as to make Lord Wensleydale an hereditary Peer. My
advice was to make him an hereditary Viscount. I was obliged to go away and had
not time to talk it out. In the afternoon, I spoke to Campbell and Lyndhurst
about it, and asked what they proposed, and how the difficulty was to be got
over. They naturally want the Government to knock under and give up the
hereditary peerage; they both scouted the idea of Parke coming down to the House
of Lords and insisting on being admitted and making a scene. Lyndhurst to-night
is to give notice of motion for a Committee to consider the Appellate
Jurisdiction.</p>


<p><i>February 27th.</i>&mdash;The debate in the Lords on Monday night affords a prospect of
an amicable termination of the Peerage case, but the Government still have a
lingering hope that by some management and contrivance they may avoid the
necessity of submitting to their defeat and acting accordingly. There is to be a
Committee on the Appellate Jurisdiction, and they think they may obtain some
report which may enable them to get out of their scrape, but the only way I can
make out by which they think of doing this is to lay the foundation of a bill to
enable the Crown to make a limited number of Life Peers. This would, however, be
a more formal acknowledgement of error, and that the Queen does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> not possess the
prerogative, than any other course. I expect they will at last be driven to
adopt the course I recommended, that of making Parke a Viscount, hereditary of
course.</p>

<p>Last night, Disraeli made a bitter attack on the Government, to which Labouchere
replied with a spirit for which nobody gave him credit. The Opposition displayed
great warmth, and a disposition to show serious fight on any occasion they could
find. Certainly the Government cuts a very poor figure, and it is difficult not
to think that as soon as the all absorbing question of peace or war is decided,
they will be much put to it to defend themselves, unless they conduct affairs
much better for the future than they have done up to the present time. Hitherto
they have presented a series of blunders, failures, and exposures. First of all
the Peerage question; then, much worse, in the House of Commons, Lowe's Bill on
Shipping Dues, which Palmerston was obliged to withdraw last night, not at all
creditably, and the failure of which was in a great measure attributable to
Lowe's very injudicious speech, which, as he is the organ of the Board of Trade
in the House of Commons, was in itself a great evil and misfortune. George
Grey's Bill on County Police meets with such opposition that though it is a very
good measure he will probably not be able to carry it. But still worse than
these are the case of the Crimean Report with all its incidents, one blunder
after another, and the wretched exhibition of Monsell in moving the Ordnance
Estimates, amounting to a complete break-down. All these things, one after
another, place the Government in a very weak and contemptible position, and show
that in spite of Palmerston's having recovered a good deal of his personal
popularity in the House of Commons, his Government has no strength, and his
being able to go on at all is only owing to the peculiar circumstances in which
the country is placed, and the extreme difficulty of any other Government being
formed which would be palateable to the country, more efficient, and therefore
stronger and more durable than the present.</p>

<p>To-morrow I purpose going to Paris to see and hear what is going on at this
interesting moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>


<div class="sidenote">A VISIT TO PARIS.</div>

<p><i>Paris, March 1st</i>, 1856.&mdash;I left London on Thursday with M. de Flahault and my
brother. We slept at Boulogne, and after a prosperous journey in all its stages,
found myself in my old quarters at the Embassy yesterday evening at seven
o'clock. I had hardly arrived before a card came from Morny, who gave a great
evening party with two <i>petites piï¿½ces</i> and music. I went there with Lady
Cowley. The crowd was so great that I saw nothing whatever of the spectacle, but
was pretty well amused, for I met some old acquaintance, made some new ones, and
was presented to some of the celebrities of the day. I was much struck with the
ugliness of the women, and the extreme <i>recherche</i> of their costumes. Nature has
done nothing for them, their <i>modistes</i> all that is possible. The old friends I
met were La Marre and Bourqueney, whom I have not seen since he was Secretary of
Embassy to Guizot, when we had so much to do together about the affairs of the
East. I made acquaintance with Fleury, the Empress's Grand ï¿½cuyer, renewed it
with Bacciochi, and I was presented to Cavour and the Grand Vizier, as little
like the <i>beau idï¿½al</i> of a Grand Vizier as can well be imagined, but by all
accounts a Turk <i>comme il y en a peu</i>. He is a very little, dark, spare,
mild-looking man, speaks French perfectly, and exceedingly clever,
well-informed, enlightened, and honourable. He was Grand Vizier once before, and
owes his present elevation to his great personal merit. He accepted the post
with reluctance, feeling sure Stratford would torment him to death and get him
turned out again, but it seems as if his high qualities, and the general respect
with which he is regarded, would enable him to maintain himself against all
intrigues, and even against Stratford's predominance. I met Clarendon, but had
hardly any opportunity of talking to him, as he was every moment interrupted by
people come up to do civilities to him. He had just time to tell me that matters
are going on very slowly, and that he sees no reason why he should not be kept
here for the next six months. Orloff had met him <i>ï¿½ bras ouverts</i> and renewed
their old Petersburg friendship. Brunnow he is disgusted with, and says he has
made a bad impression here. He told me he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> said to Brunnow: 'You were in
England long enough to know what a special pleader is; well, if all other trades
should fail you, take to that.'</p>

<p>Orloff spoke very frankly about the war, and the conduct of the late Emperor,
which he had always regarded as insane in sending Menschikoff to Constantinople.
If he had sent him, Orloff, instead, he would answer for it, there would have
been no war. Then marching into the Principalities, and finally not accepting
the modifications of the Vienna Note. After this, Orloff said, he had declined
to have anything more to do with those affairs, and had retired in disgust. He
thought Nicholas's mind had undergone a change after he had reached sixty years
of age.</p>

<p>Clarendon said he was delighted with the Emperor and liked him better and better
every time he saw him. I met Walewski, who said he wanted to talk to me, when he
expressed great anxiety to know the state of opinion in England, and talked of
the chances of peace, and particularly wished to know if I thought Palmerston
really and sincerely desired peace. I told him the exact truth as to opinion in
England, and said I believed Palmerston was now sincere in wishing to make
peace, but that it was in his nature to be <i>exigeant</i>, and he thought it
necessary to be so now because it was of great moment to him to present to the
country a peace with as many concessions as possible from Russia. I said it
depended on France after all, and then I found that while they thought Bomarsund
ought to be an indispensable condition, Nicolaieff ought not; and so we parted,
and I promised to dine with him on Monday.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD COWLEY ON THE NEGOTIATIONS.</div>

<p>This morning after breakfast I had a long conversation with Cowley. He did not
speak despondingly of the peace, but he dilated on the difficulty of coming to
satisfactory terms, and such as Clarendon could consent to, which he attributes
principally to the French, who, having gained all the glory they want for the
satisfaction of their national vanity, have no longer any desire to go on with
the war, and we are placed by them in a fix. 'If,' he said, 'our army was in
Asia Minor he should not care, because then we might say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> to them, do just what
you please, make peace if it suits you, we shall not resent it or have any
quarrel with you, but we will carry on the war on our own account. As it is, if
we insist on renewing the war, the French <i>cannot</i>, and would not abandon us,
and leave us to be attacked by superior Russian armies; they would therefore
very reluctantly go on with the war, but it would be well known that we were
dragging them on with us, and the exasperation against us would be great and
general, and, say what we might, a quarrel between France and England would
infallibly ensue.' He said all the objections he had entertained against Paris
being the place of conference had been more than realised, and that the thing to
have done would have been to have it in some dull German town, where there would
have been no amusements and occupations, and no intrigues, and where they would
have applied themselves vigorously to their work in order to get it done as
quickly as possible. I have not, however, as yet made out what intrigues there
are, but there is of course a vast deal of <i>commï¿½rage</i> going on.</p>

<p>The conferences take place every other day, beginning at one, and they generally
last about four hours. Walewski presides, and, they say, does it pretty well; M.
Benedetti, the Chef de Dï¿½partement in the Foreign Office, is the Protocollist
and Rï¿½dacteur; the manner of it is conversational, but they occasionally make
speeches, Walewski told me. I asked Clarendon in the evening how they were going
on, and he said he thought they were making a little progress, but that the
French did all they could to render it impossible.</p>

<p>I called on Madame de Lieven in the morning, who did not seem to know much
beyond what lies on the surface. She is craving for news and eager for peace.
Orloff has kept aloof from her, to her great mortification, and rather to the
malicious satisfaction of her enemies, but he went to see her at last the day
before yesterday, and, I suppose, accounted for the delay, for she spoke of him
as if they were friends, though of course she would take care not to say a word
of complaint or to have it supposed, if she could help it, that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
neglected her. She complained that in our <i>exigeance</i> we did not make allowance
enough for the difficulties of the Emperor of Russia's position, for, however
necessary peace might be to Russia, there is a very great party there who from
pride and obstinacy would carry on the war at all risks and hazards. She talked
much of the enormous faults that had been committed throughout the whole of the
Eastern Question, and of the severe retribution the pride of the late Emperor
had drawn down on his country, and remarked, which is quite true, that this
would be the first time in the history of Russia in which she had made a
disadvantageous peace; for even in her wars against Napoleon, when she had
suffered defeat after defeat, she had still concluded peace with a gain of
territory. I saw the Hollands, Guizot at Madame de Lieven's door, called on Lady
Clarendon, and then went to ride with Lady Cowley in the Bois, and so the
evening and the morning were the first day. The weather is cold and gloomy, and
I don't think I shall stay here long.</p>


<p><i>March 3rd.</i>&mdash;Went about visiting yesterday, and at night to the Tuileries, an
evening party and play, two small pieces; the Emperor was very civil to me as
usual, came up to me and shook hands; he talked to Orloff and to Clarendon, then
the Grande Maï¿½tresse told him the Empress was ready, when he went out and came
back with her on his arm, Mathilde, Princess Murat, and Plon Plon following. As
the Emperor passed before me, he stopped and presented me to the Empress. I was
introduced to Orloff, and in the course of the evening had a long talk with
Brunnow, who said <i>they</i> had made all the advances and concessions they could,
and it was for us to move towards peace, and not to advance one step and then
retreat two.</p>

<p>This morning I went to see the opening of the legislative bodies, and hear the
Emperor's Speech. It was a gay and pretty sight, so full of splendour and
various colours, but rather theatrical. He read his speech very well and the
substance of it gave satisfaction; it was not easy to compose it, but he did it
exceedingly well, and steered clear of the ticklish points with great adroitness
and tact. It sounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> odd to English ears to hear a Royal Speech applauded at
the end of each paragraph, and the shouts of 'Vive l'Empereur' from the Senators
and Deputies.</p>

<p>After Cowley came home he began talking over the state of affairs, and the peace
we are going to make, about which his grief and disappointment are overflowing.
He says the Emperor had the best intentions, but has been beset with men who
were determined on peace for their own ends, and whom he could not resist. What
he blames him for is not having at once said that he would go so far with us and
no further, and not have allowed us to delude ourselves with expectations of
support from him that were not to be realised. He says it is now all over, the
matter decided, it will proceed rapidly, and all be finished by Easter.</p>


<div class="sidenote">A DINNER AT COUNT WALEWSKI'S.</div>

<p><i>At night.</i>&mdash;I have been dining with Walewski, a very handsome dinner to the
Sardinians, and a party afterwards. Knowing none of the people, it was a bore; I
found nobody to converse with but Cavour and Flahault; talked over the state of
affairs with the latter and our discontents. He said the Emperor could not
refuse, and when Clarendon came over and found His Majesty's conversation so
satisfactory, he was misled by it and fancied he should obtain his support to
all our demands; he owned that it would have been better if the Emperor had been
more explicit. When I got home I found Cowley, who was engaged in drawing up a
statement of the comparative state of Russia, as to her aggressive power against
Turkey before the war and now, after peace has been made. He is doing this for
Clarendon and to assist him in making his case good in Parliament when the peace
is attacked, as he says it is quite certain it will be. I asked him what were
the points on which the Russians made the most difficulty. He said on <i>all</i>
except Bomarsund. He is quite convinced that Walewski has played false, and that
he has made known to Orloff exactly what he must give up, and when he may be
stout.</p>


<p><i>March 5th.</i>&mdash;Little to record; Cowley continues talking to me of the state of
affairs as it is and as it might have been, and is excessively dejected and
disgusted at the idea of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> peace he is about to sign; he thinks it neither
creditable nor likely to be durable, but we start from such different points of
view that it is impossible for us to agree. He harps upon the evil done by
having the Conference here, and certainly the advantage Clarendon promised
himself from having it here has proved null, for the Emperor does not send for
him, having no mind to talk to him, and he will not ask an audience of the
Emperor, though Cowley urges him very much to do it. He acknowledges, however,
that it would be now too late, and that nothing more can be done; he thinks
Clarendon will bring himself with great reluctance to sign such a Treaty; but he
must swallow the pill, however bitter. The bitterness proceeds from having had
such vast pretensions and having encouraged, if not held, such lofty language.</p>

<p>It is no wonder that this Government want to get their army home when typhus is
raging there, and they have by their own account 22,000 men in hospital, while
ours is quite healthy. We took all sorts of precautions, and strongly advised
the French to do the same, and to adopt a sanitary plan we imparted to them;
they held it cheap, did nothing, and here are the consequences. It is said that
while those who have been in the Crimea and have distinguished themselves are
eager for peace, those who have not yet earned medals are averse to peace, and
that there will be a good deal of jealousy between the regiments.</p>


<p><i>March 6th.</i>&mdash;We talked yesterday morning about the origin of the Austrian
proposals, and Cowley said he had never been able exactly to make out whether
the scheme had originated at Vienna or here, but he was inclined to believe that
the first hint was given by Austria, and that Walewski then put the thing on
paper, which was sent to Vienna and returned thence in the shape of a proposal.
Bourqueney first brought it from Vienna, Buol having obtained his Emperor's
consent to it. Cowley told me Buol had been all along willing to join us in the
war, but the Emperor never would consent to it. Cowley's notions are that we
never ought to have listened to any intervention, nor to any pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>posals for
peace but from Russia herself, that we should have made her sue for peace. He
would have had our demands from the first stated distinctly, and have allowed of
nothing but acceptance or refusal; he would never have agreed to the article for
the cession of Bessarabia, nor have asked for territory at all. If it could have
been managed he would have preferred giving the Principalities to Austria, who
should for them give up Lombardy to Sardinia. Not a bad idea. By the by, it is
much noticed that in the Emperor's Speech he calls the King of Sardinia the King
of Piedmont, probably without any particular meaning or intention, but they say
he never does anything without a meaning. I rode to the new racecourse
yesterday, near the Bois de Boulogne, and went to the Opera last night to see a
beautiful new ballet, 'Le Corsaire.' Went to Passy to see the Delesserts, who
were out.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BITTERNESS IN FRENCH SOCIETY.</div>

<p>In this head quarter of gossip every trifle makes a noise, a little scene in
society excites interest and shows the continued violence of party feeling. A
party dined at Lord Holland's and more came in the evening, mostly, as it
happened, Orleanists, for the Hollands live with all parties indiscriminately.
There were Mesdames de Rï¿½musat, d'Haussonville, and several others of that
colour, when the door opened and MM. de Flahault and Morny were announced, on
which the women all jumped up like a covey of partridges and walked out of the
room, without taking any notice of the men. It is said that the Orleanist party
entertain a peculiar rancour against M. de Flahault for having seen behind a
door or a curtain the arrest of General Changarnier on the 2nd of December,
which he afterwards had the folly to avow.</p>


<p><i>At night.</i>&mdash;Just before dinner came an invitation to go to the Tuileries
to-night, which with much reluctance I was forced to do. Two <i>petites piï¿½ces</i> as
on Sunday. I did not attempt to get into the gallery, and sat in the next room,
first with Brunnow, then with the Grand Vizier, who is become a great friend of
mine. The Emperor did nothing but take off one Plenipotentiary after another:
first Clarendon, next Buol, then Orloff, and lastly Walewski, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> probably more
was done there than at the Conference in the morning. Brunnow and Walewski both
told me the affair was progressing, and Cowley seemed very low coming home. His
dejection is extreme, and he said this morning that he could not recover from
his extreme disappointment at the conduct of the Emperor, that he had always had
a bad opinion of Walewski, and no reliance on him or any of the ministers, but
he would have staked his life on the Emperor's remaining true to us, that he had
always assured our Government that they might depend implicitly on him, and it
was a bitter mortification to him to have been deceived himself and to deceive
them. I asked him how Clarendon felt all this, and he said Clarendon had never
spoken to him about it, and preserved a calmness which astonished him. 'What,' I
asked, 'did the Cabinet at home say?' He said, 'They seemed to place entire
confidence in Clarendon, and to leave all power and responsibility to him.'</p>


<p><i>March 8th.</i>&mdash;Called on M. de Greffuhle yesterday, whom I had not seen for
years. He is eighty, enormously rich, full of activity and intelligence,
Orleanist by social habits, but well affected towards this Government and not
hostile to the Emperor, though despising his Government. He said that he was
<i>compelled</i> to make peace, and that it would cost him his Crown if he did not;
that <i>something</i> would happen and then he would be upset, so great would be the
consequences of his running counter to the universal desire for peace here; that
the finances are in a very difficult state and there must be another loan, but
it would not be contracted like the last, which was a piece of absurd
<i>charlatanerie</i>.</p>

<p>I went in the afternoon to see the Imperial stables, a wonderful establishment;
and then the stallions, near Passy. In the evening to Madame Baudon's, where I
was presented to General Cavaignac, but had no conversation with him. He is a
tall, gentlemanlike man with a very military air. I was surprised to see him
there in the midst of the Legitimists, he, a republican, but it seems he was
once near marrying Madame Baudon, who was sous-gouvernante des Enfants de France
when Madame de Gontaut was Gouvernante.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>


<p><i>March 9th.</i>&mdash;Went about visiting as usual. Called on Achille Fould, who
introduced me to Magne, Minister of Finance, said to be a great rogue.
Everything here is intrigue and jobbery, and I am told there is a sort of gang,
of which Morny is the chief, who all combine for their own purpose and
advantage: Morny, Tould, Magne, and Rouher, Minister of Commerce. They now want
to get out Billault, Minister of the Interior, whom they cannot entirely manage,
and that ministry is necessary to them, on account of the railroads, which are
under his management. Fould was full of civilities and offers of services, and
he told me the Emperor has a mind to talk to me; whether anything will come of
it I know not. I went thence to Madame de Galliera's, where I met Thiers and
made a <i>rendez-vous</i> with him for to-day; then to Madame de Lieven who had had
Orloff with her; lastly to Madame de Girardin and renewed our old acquaintance,
dined with Delmar, and came home to a great party here.</p>


<div class="sidenote">CONVERSATION WITH M. THIERS.</div>

<p><i>March 10th.</i>&mdash;I called on Thiers yesterday, and had a long talk with him; he
declared he was happier unemployed and quite free than he had ever been; he had
been all for the war, and was now as much for peace&mdash;like every other Frenchman
he considered it a necessity; anxious as ever for the English alliance, and
ridiculed the idea that we had not accomplished everything that our honour and
glory required; bitter against this Government, and maintained that the Emperor
might very safely relax the severity of it without giving up anything; indignant
with the peculation and corruption that prevailed, and the abominable acts of
injustice committed, one of which he mentioned towards his own family. Very
pleasant as usual.</p>

<p>The news of the day was the dangerous illness of King Jerome, whose life hangs
on a thread. This morning I went to St. Germains to see a stag hunt in the
forest&mdash;a curious sight, with the old-fashioned <i>meute</i>; the officers, and those
privileged to wear the uniform, in embroidered coats, jackboots, and cocked
hats; piqueurs on horseback and foot with vast horns wound round their bodies;
the costume and the sport<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> exactly as in the time of Louis XIV., rather tiresome
after a time. The old chateau is a melancholy <i>dï¿½labrï¿½</i> building, sad as the
finishing career of its last Royal inhabitant. These recollections come thick
upon one&mdash;Anne of Austria and the Fronde, Louis XIV. and Mademoiselle de la
Valliï¿½re&mdash;for here their lives began. When the Queen was here she insisted on
being taken up to see Mademoiselle de la Valliï¿½re's apartment, to mark which
some slight ornaments remain. Here too James II. held his dismal Court and came
to his unhappy and bigoted end. After it ceased to be a palace, it became
successively a prison, a school, and a barrack, and now the Emperor has a fancy
to restore it. I went at night to a great concert at Walewski's, where I fell in
with Clarendon, and found he was quite prepared to make peace even on such terms
as he can get, in which I encouraged him, and to my surprise he said he did not
think it would be a bad peace, though it was not so good as we might have got if
the generals had done all they might, or if we had had another campaign. He
asked me how I thought people would look on it in England, and I told him from
all I heard I thought <i>now</i> the wish was for peace, and that the peace would be
well enough taken. This he now thinks himself, and he said peace would certainly
be concluded before the end of the month.</p>


<p><i>March 15th.</i>&mdash;From Cowley's account the Conferences appear to be drawing to an
end, as a committee has been formed to draw up the Treaty. It consists of
Cowley, Bourqueney, Brunnow, Cavour, Buol, and the Grand Vizier. Cowley is still
bemoaning the insufficiency of the terms, and while he admits the necessity of
peace here, maintains that if the Emperor would only have joined us in insisting
upon the terms we wished to impose, it is certain the Russians would have
consented to everything, for he says they now know from unquestionable
information that the Russians expected much harder terms. The Emperor was,
however, so beset by his <i>entourage</i>, and so afraid of running the slightest
risk of the Russians breaking off the negotiations, that he would not insist on
anything which he was not certain the Russians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> would agree to, and Cowley says
he thinks Clarendon was not so firm as he might have been, and if he had pressed
the Emperor more strongly, that the latter would have yielded and told Orloff
that, though anxious to make peace, he was still more anxious to continue on
good terms with us, and that if the Russian Government wanted peace, they would
only have it on such and such terms. All this may be true, and I am myself
inclined to think the Russians would have agreed to our terms, if those terms
had been heartily backed up by the Emperor; but except to give something more of
a triumph to the English public, I am not of opinion that the difference between
what we required and what we shall get is worth much. When the <i>dï¿½nouement</i> is
before the world, it will appear how insane it was to plunge into such a war,
and that the confusion and unsettled state of affairs which will be the result
of it are more dangerous to the stability of the Turkish Empire than the
ambitious designs of Russia ever were. Whether the Emperor Nicholas was
premature or not in his idea of 'the sick man,' it will soon appear how sick the
man will be left by the doctors who have stepped in to save him, and I believe
the <i>bouleversement</i> of the old Turkish dominion will have been greatly
accelerated by the war and the consequences which will flow from the successes
of the allies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CIRCASSIANS.</div>

<p>What Cowley particularly laments over is having failed to dismantle Nicolaieff
and to stop the outlet from the Bug to the Black Sea, and having got no
satisfactory arrangement with regard to the Circassian coast and the contiguous
provinces which were ceded to Russia by the Treaty of Adrianople. We wanted that
Russia should acknowledge the independence of these provinces or of some part of
them; but I cannot see of what use this would have been, and it would have been
a matter of the greatest difficulty how to secure their independence and under
what Government. There is a sort of sympathy with the Circassians in England,
which would have made some stipulations with regard to them popular; but the
independence would be illusory, Russia would soon reassert her authority, and
our stipu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>lations would become a dead letter, or we should be involved in
endless disputes without any satisfactory results. As to forming another
coalition for the sake of semi-barbarous nationalities on the coasts of the
Caspian, nothing would be more impossible. England herself, who will soon
recover from her madness, would not hear of it, and France still less. The war
was founded in delusion and error, and carried on by a factitious and ignorant
enthusiasm, and we richly deserve to reap nothing but mortification and
disappointment in return for all the blood and treasure we have spent.</p>


<p><i>March 16th.</i>&mdash;We passed the day in momentary expectation of hearing of the
Empress's confinement. No news arrived, but at six in the morning we were
awakened from our beds by the sound of the cannon of the Invalides, which gave
notice of a son. Will his fortune be more prosperous than that of the other
Royal and Imperial heirs to the throne whom similar salvoes have proclaimed? It
is a remarkable coincidence that the confinement was as difficult and dangerous
as that of Marie Louise, with the same symptoms and circumstances, and that the
doctor accoucheur (Dubois) in this instance was the son of the Dubois who
attended the other Empress. From all I hear the event was received here with
good will, but without the least enthusiasm, though with some curiosity, and the
Tuileries Gardens were crowded. People were invited by the police to
illuminate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RETURN TO ENGLAND.</div>

<p><i>London, March 21st, Good Friday.</i>&mdash;I left Paris on Wednesday morning with Mr.
and Mrs. Reeve, dined at Boulogne, crossed over in the evening, and arrived in
London yesterday morning at eleven o'clock. When near Folkestone we were caught
in a fog, lost our way, and were very near having to anchor and pass the night
at sea. After a vast deal of whistling and bellowing, stopping and going on, the
fog cleared a little, lights became visible, and we entered the harbour with no
other inconvenience than having made a long <i>dï¿½tour</i>, and being an hour later
than our proper time. I regretted leaving Paris, where I was treated with so
much affection and hospitality, and on the whole very well amused. On Monday, I
dined with the Duchesse de Mouchy; on Tuesday night Clarendon came after dinner
to see me before my departure, and we had some talk about the peace and the
terms. He spoke very cheerfully about it and seems not at all dissatisfied, nor
to feel any alarm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> about its reception. As it is, without at all acknowledging
that he has made any sacrifices, he considers that the influence he has acquired
for England, particularly with Austria and Turkey, is far more valuable than any
items of concession from Russia would have been. Buol told him that he was now
quite convinced that England was the Power to which Austria must really look
with confidence and reliance on her honour and friendship, and the Turk was
still more warm and vehement in assurances of the same kind. This was elicited
from the Austrians by the fact of England having supported the condition of the
Bessarabian cession, while France took part with Russia and threw Austria over.
Moreover, Clarendon does not, like Cowley, complain of the Emperor Napoleon, but
speaks with great satisfaction of His Majesty's conduct to him, and the renewed
cordiality with which he has recently expressed himself towards England, and for
the maintenance of his alliance with us. In short, he evidently thinks, and not
without reason, that he will return, having obtained a sufficiently good peace,
and having placed England in a very fine position. He said that he had been able
to accomplish his task by being ready to incur responsibility at home, and by
being able to act unfettered, and taking on himself to disregard any
instructions or recommendations from home that he did not approve of. Yesterday
I saw George Lewis and had a talk with him and his wife about Clarendon and the
peace. He said he thought the peace quite sufficient, and he did not understand
what it was Cowley found fault with, nor why he is dissatisfied. He denies that
we have given up anything that it would have been just and reasonable to stand
out upon, and will not hear of taking an apologetic tone, but that Clarendon
should defend the peace on its own merits. He thinks it will be well enough
received in the House of Commons and by the country, and he is in good spirits
about the Government. He says Palmerston has been moderate and reasonable, and
that he is not aware of Clarendon's having been harassed with any instructions,
but left entirely to his own discretion. They all think he has done exceedingly
well.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIR EDMUND LYONS' NARRATIVE.</div>

<p><i>March 29th.</i>&mdash;I went to Hatchford on Saturday last; on Wednesday to Althorp. I
met Sir Edmund Lyons at Hatchford, who talked incessantly about the incidents of
the war and the conduct of the people concerned in it, and very interesting his
talk was, for besides having been one of the most conspicuous and important
actors in it, he was completely in the confidence of the Commanders-in-Chief,
and consulted by them on every occasion and with regard to all operations. He
told us what had passed between Evans and Raglan and between Evans and himself
on a most important occasion, to this effect: Evans went to Raglan immediately
after the battle of Inkerman, and proposed to him to embark the army
immediately, leaving their guns, and (Lyons says he is almost certain) their
sick and wounded to the enemy. Raglan said, 'But you forget the French: would
you have us abandon them to their fate?' He replied, 'You are Commander-in-Chief
of the <i>English</i> army, and it is your business to provide for <i>its</i> safety....'
Raglan would not hear of the proposal. Almost immediately after Evans met Sir
Edmund Lyons and told him what had passed with Raglan, and urged him to suggest
the same course. Lyons made the same observation about the French that Raglan
had done, and said one of two things would happen: either the French would take
Sebastopol alone, when we should be covered with shame and dishonour; or they
would fail and probably suffer some great disaster. The expression of 'perfide
Albion' had long been current in France, and then indeed it would be well
deserved and would become a perpetual term of reproach against us. These rebuffs
did not prevent Evans going on board ship and there giving out that the army
would in a few days be obliged to embark, and Captain Dacres came to Lyons and
told him he heard this was going to happen. Lyons asked him where he had heard
this, and he said Evans had announced it, and talked of it unreservedly as
certain to happen. Lyons said, 'It is false; the army will not go away, and
Sebastopol will be taken. It is very mischievous that such reports should
circulate, and I order you not to allow such a thing to be said by anybody on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
board your ship, and to contradict it in the most positive manner.'</p>

<p>Everything that Lyons said, and it may be added all one hears in every way,
tends to the honour and the credit of Raglan, and I am glad to record this
because I have always had an impression that much of the difficulty and distress
of the army in 1854 was owing to his want of energy and management. He was not a
Wellington certainly, and probably he might have done more and better than he
did, but he was unquestionably, on the whole, the first man in the army, and if
he had not been continually thwarted by the French, would have done more. While
many here were crying out for placing our army under the command of French
generals, and recalling Raglan (and I must confess I had myself a considerable
leaning that way), he was struggling against the shortcomings or the inactivity
of Canrobert and Pï¿½lissier. Canrobert acknowledged that he had not nerves
sufficient for the duties of his station, and he never could be got to agree to
adopt the bold offensive movements which Raglan was continually urging upon him,
especially after the battle of Inkerman, when Raglan entreated him to follow up
the discomfited Russians, his whole army being ready and not above 1,500 of them
having been engaged. With Pï¿½lissier, Raglan had very little to do, for his death
occurred soon after Pï¿½lissier took the command.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LYONS DEFENDS LORD RAGLAN.</div>

<p>Lyons gave us an interesting account of Raglan's last illness. He seemed to have
no idea that he was in serious danger, nor had the people about him. At last,
when he was so rapidly sinking that the doctors saw his end was approaching, and
it was deemed necessary to apprise him thereof, he would not believe it, and he
insisted to his aide-de-camp who told him of his state that he was better, and
he fell into a state of insensibility without ever having been conscious of his
dying condition. One of the best authenticated charges against Raglan was that
of his not showing himself to his soldiers, and it was said many believed that
he had quitted the camp; at last this idea became so prevalent that his own
staff felt the necessity of something being said to him about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> it, but none
dared, for it seems they were all exceedingly afraid of him. At last they asked
Lyons if he would speak to him and tell him what was said. Lyons said he had no
scruple or difficulty in so doing, and told him plainly the truth. Raglan not
only took it in good part, but thanked him very much, and said his reason for
not riding round all the divisions was that he could not prevent the soldiers
turning out to salute him, and he could not bear to see this ceremony done by
the men who had been all night in the trenches or otherwise exposed to fatigue,
and that this was the sole reason why he had abstained, but henceforward he
would make a point of riding round every day, and so he ever after did; so that
the main fact as reported by 'correspondents' was not devoid of truth. I wish I
could recollect all the various anecdotes Lyons told us, but I neglected to put
them down at the time, and now they have faded from my memory. He discussed the
qualities of the English generals with reference to the command of the army
after Raglan's death. He never had well understood why it was that Colin
Campbell was always considered out of the question, and his own opinion seemed
to be that he was the fittest man. The French thought so, and one of the alleged
reasons against him, viz., that he could not speak French, was certainly not
true. Simpson was very reluctant to take the command at first, and wrote home to
say so, but after he had received certain flattering encouragements his
opposition waxed fainter, and by the time it was taken from him he became
anxious to retain it. Raglan was not at all annoyed at Simpson's being sent
there, and did what he pleased with him. Simpson never attempted to interfere
with him or to control him in any way, but on the contrary was entirely
subservient to Raglan.</p>


<p><i>April 1st.</i>&mdash;News of peace reached London on Sunday evening, and was received
joyfully by the populace, not from any desire to see an end of the war, but
merely because it is a great event to make a noise about. The newspapers have
been reasonable enough, except the 'Sun,' which appeared in deep mourning and
with a violent tirade against peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>


<div class="sidenote">SIR JAMES GRAHAM ON THE STATE OF PARTIES.</div>

<p><i>April 3rd.</i>&mdash;Yesterday I met Graham at the Council Office, where he had come
to attend a committee. Since the formation of Aberdeen's Government three years
ago I have hardly ever seen him, and have never had any conversation with him.
Yesterday he sat down and began talking over the state of affairs generally, and
the prospects of the country, which he considers very gloomy and full of danger,
more particularly from the outrageous license of the press, which has now
arrived at a pitch perfectly intolerable, but which it is impossible to check or
control. Then the total destruction of parties and of party ties and connexions,
to say nothing of the antipathies and disagreements of such public men as these
are. He says there is not one man in the House of Commons who has ten followers,
neither Gladstone, nor Disraeli, nor Palmerston. The Government goes on because
there is no organized opposition prepared and able to take its place, and the
Government receives a sufficiency of independent support, because all feel that
the business of the country must be carried on, and hitherto Palmerston has been
supported as a War Minister, and the best man to carry on the war; but Graham is
very doubtful what will happen when the discussions on the peace and all matters
relating to the war are over, and other questions (principally of domestic
policy) come into play. Palmerston, always sanguine, fancies he can stand, but
it is very doubtful, for he is not backed by a party constituting a majority;
the Treasury Bench is very weak, and Palmerston himself a poor and inefficient
conductor of the Government in the House. John Russell has taken up the question
of education, which he hopes to render popular, and through it means again to
recover his former influence and authority. He said that John Russell is (in
spite of all that happened last year) more looked up to by the Whig party than
Palmerston, and that they would rather have him for their leader, as,
notwithstanding the faults he has committed, he is by far the ablest man, has a
much greater grasp of intellect, more foresight, and is much more of a
statesman, and has fixed principles. Palmerston (Graham thinks) has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
passionate love of office and power, and will cling to it with tenacity to the
last, and never resign it but on compulsion, not caring with whom he acts, nor
on what principles. This, I think, is partly true and partly false. I do not
think he cares whom he acts with, but I do not believe he is quite indifferent
as to the principles. He says Lewis has done well, and is liked in the House of
Commons, and Gladstone likes him and gives him a cordial support; that Baines is
a good man, and those two are the most respected and considered of all the men
on the Treasury Bench, the House accepting their sterling qualities in place of
greater brilliancy such as Gladstone can command; that Gladstone is certainly
the ablest man there, though it is still doubtful whether his talents are equal
to such an emergency as the present to master public opinion, enlist it on his
side, and to administer the Government on certain principles of administrative
reform, which Graham himself considers necessary. His religious opinions, in
which he is zealous and sincere, enter so largely into his political conduct as
to form a very serious obstacle to his success, for they are abhorrent to the
majority of this Protestant country, and (I was rather surprised to hear him
say) Graham thinks approach very nearly to Rome. Gladstone would have nothing to
do with any Government unless he were leader in the House of Commons, and when
that Government is formed, there should be previously a clear and distinct
understanding on what principles it was founded and what their course of action
should be. His tone is now that of disclaiming party connexions, and being ready
to join with any men who are able and willing to combine in carrying out such
measures as are indispensably necessary for the good government of the country,
such a system as he briefly shadowed out in his speech at the Mansion House the
other day. Graham's idea is, that in the event of this Government breaking down,
the best chance of another being formed would be by Clarendon undertaking it,
whom on the whole he regards as the man best fitted by his experience and
ability to be at the head of affairs; that he and Gladstone might be brought
together, but would Lord John consent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> go to the Lords, and to serve under
Clarendon as President of the Council and Head of the Education Department? This
opens questions full of doubt and difficulty. Derby, he thinks, has no desire to
form another Government, and would prefer to go on as he is now, leader of a
large party of Peers who are willing to follow him and to make the House of
Lords one of the scenes and instruments of his amusements as usual, provided it
supplies him with occupation and excitement, indifferent to the consequences and
to the mischief he may do. Disraeli appears to be endeavouring to approach
Gladstone, and a confederacy between those two and young Stanley by no means an
improbability. What Stanley is disposed to do and capable of doing is still an
enigma, and although his speeches are not devoid of matter, they are without a
particle of the spirit and stirring eloquence of his father.</p>

<p>The change which has taken place in the country presents to Graham a most
alarming prospect. Hitherto it has been governed by parties, and patronage has
been the great instrument of keeping parties together; whereas Sir Robert Peel
has destroyed party, which had now entirely ceased to exist; and between the
press, the public opinion which the press had made, and the views of certain
people in Parliament, of whom Gladstone is the most eminent and strenuous,
patronage was either destroyed or going rapidly to destruction. The only hope of
escaping from great perils was in that broad stratum of good sense and firmness
which still existed in the country, and of which manifestations had been
recently given. He admires the resolute and unflinching spirit with which the
war had been entered into, carried on, and the country was quite willing to
persist in; and not less the sensible and reasonable manner in which the peace,
by which they were mortified and disappointed, had been acquiesced in, for he
says that it is beyond all question that there is throughout the country a
strong feeling of mortification and regret that we have not played a more
brilliant part, and that our share of glory has been less than that of our ally,
and there would have been a general feeling of exultation and satisfaction if we
had fought another campaign in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> order to end the war with greater <i>ï¿½clat</i>. But
this sentiment has been sufficiently mastered by prudent considerations and a
just appreciation of the circumstances of Europe generally, and of our relations
with other Powers, to check all ebullitions of mortified pride, and to induce a
prudent reserve and acquiesce in the management of the Government, and in a
spirit like this there appears some hope for the future. We had a very long talk
about these and other matters, the substance of which I record as it recurs to
my mind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EDWARD ELLICE ON THE STATE OF PARTIES.</div>

<p>A day or two before I met Ellice at Hillingdon, where we interchanged our
thoughts, and a good deal that he said was much in Graham's sense: that this
Government could not stand but by being remodelled, and his notion is that half
of it should be got rid of, the Peelites taken in, and Lord John to go to the
House of Lords as President of the Council, Granville taking Cowley's place as
ambassador at Paris, and Cowley replacing Stratford Canning at Constantinople.
<i>ï¿½ propos</i> of Stratford Canning, Graham thinks the Opposition will attack the
Government and not the ambassador on the case of Kars, and that it is not
impossible they may carry a vote of censure against them, which I told him I did
not believe was possible, or that they could be able to carry any resolution
affecting the Government so much as to compel their resignation, and I suggested
to him how fatal this would be to his scheme of reorganizing a Government under
Clarendon, as such censure would more especially touch him, and this would make
it impossible for the Queen to entrust the formation of another Government to
his hands.</p>


<p><i>April 7th.</i>&mdash;Since my conversation with Graham, I have learnt from the Duke of
Bedford that Lord John is not very much disinclined to go to the House of Lords,
particularly as his position in reference to his seat for the City is so
embarrassing. The Dissenters, always unreasonable and ungrateful, will not
forgive his speech upon Church Rates the other night, and his general popularity
is gone. Then it is probably a consideration with him to secure to his family
the settlement his brother will make on him if he takes the peerage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>


<p><i>London, May 4th.</i>&mdash;For nearly a month I have let this journal fall into arrear,
during which period the most interesting occurrences have been the return of
Clarendon, the publication of the conditions of peace with the accompanying
protocols, and the debate upon Kars. With regard to the peace, Clarendon comes
very well out of his mission, and no fault is found with the peace. The Kars
debate was a great error on the part of the Opposition, and ended with a great
triumph for the Government. Just before it, Palmerston called a meeting of his
supporters, where he harangued them with great success, and managed to rally
them round him with more of zeal and cordiality than they have hitherto shown.
His position is certainly improved, and according to present appearances he will
get through the session without much difficulty. All agree that he has been
doing well in the House of Commons; his assiduity, his punctual attendance, and
his popular manners make him agreeable to the House, and he has exhibited
greater facility and resource in dealing with all sorts of miscellaneous
subjects than anybody gave him credit for. There is not the smallest danger of
the peace proving dangerous to him, and it is evident that the House of Commons,
however independent and undisciplined it may be, will not allow him to be placed
in any danger, and is determined not to have any change of Government at
present. The Peelites and John Russell supported him and had nothing else to do,
for they are neither of them in a condition to attempt to play a game of their
own.</p>


<p><i>May 14th.</i>&mdash;Every day my disinclination to continue this work (which is neither
a journal nor anything else) increases, but I have at the same time a reluctance
to discontinue entirely an occupation which has engaged me for forty years, and
in which I may still find from time to time something to record which may
hereafter be deemed worth reading, and so at long intervals, and for short
periods, I resume my reluctant pen.</p>

<p>We are now in the Whitsuntide holidays, in a profound political and
parliamentary calm, the Government perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> secure, Palmerston very popular,
the Opposition disheartened and disunited, and having managed their matters as
awkwardly and stupidly as possible, attacking the Government on questions and
points on which the assailants were sure to be beaten, and strengthening instead
of weakening it by their abortive attempts. There was great difference of
opinion amongst them about fighting battles, on Kars, and on the peace;
Lyndhurst and Derby were against, Disraeli was for. Roebuck, whom I fell in with
on Sunday in a railway train, told me that if they had laid hold of the one
point of the protocol in the Belgian press, and worked this well, they might
have put the Government in a minority, but they missed this obvious
opportunity.<a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_3" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> I called on Lyndhurst yesterday, who said they had unaccountably
overlooked this plausible topic. He is going to make a speech on Italy when
Parliament meets, and we agreed entirely that either too much or too little was
done at Paris on this question, and that either it ought not to have been
entertained and discussed at all, or some more decided measures ought to have
been adopted with regard to it. To stir up such delicate questions, and leave
them in their present unhappy condition, is an egregious error.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1_3" id="Footnote_1_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_3"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [An attempt had been made at the Congress of Paris by Count Walewski
to bring forward some measure or resolution reflecting on the independence of
the press in Belgium. It led to nothing, but Lord Clarendon was accused of not
having protested against it with sufficient energy.]</p></div>


<div class="sidenote">A SABBATARIAN QUESTION.</div>

<p>The questions of war and of peace having now ceased to interest and excite the
public mind, a religious question has sprung up to take their place for the
moment, which though not at present of much importance, will in all probability
lead to more serious consequences hereafter. Sir Benjamin Hall having bethought
himself of providing innocent amusement for the Londoners on Sunday, established
a Sunday playing of military bands in Kensington Gardens and in the other parks
and gardens about the metropolis, which has been carried on, with the sanction
of the Government, with great success for several Sundays. Some murmurs were
heard from the puritanical and Sabbatarian party, but Palmerston having declared
himself favourable to the practice in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> House of Commons, the opposition
appeared to cease. The puritans, however, continued to agitate against it in
meetings and in the press, though the best part of the latter was favourable to
the bands, and at last, when a motion in Parliament was threatened to insist on
the discontinuance of the music, the Cabinet thought it necessary to reconsider
the subject. They were informed that if the Government resisted the motion they
would be beaten, and moreover that no man could support them in opposition to it
without great danger of losing his seat at the next election. It is stated that
the Sabbatarians are so united and numerous, and their organisation so complete,
that all over the country they would be able to influence and probably carry any
election, and that this influence would be brought to bear against every man who
maintained by his vote this 'desecration of the Sabbath.' Accordingly it was
resolved by the Cabinet to give way, and the only question was how to do so with
anything like consistency and dignity. The Archbishop of Canterbury was made the
'Deus ex machinï¿½' to effect this object. He was made to write a letter to the
Premier representing the feelings of the people and begging the bands might be
silenced. To this Palmerston wrote a reply in which he repeated his own opinion
in favour of the music, but that in deference to the public sentiment he would
put an end to their playing. All this has excited a good deal of interest and
discussion. For the present, the only question is whether the angry public will
not vent its indignation and resentment to-morrow in acts of uproar and
violence; but though these acts will not be serious or lasting if they do take
place, it may be expected that the Sabbatarians will not rest satisfied with
their triumph, but will endeavour to make fresh encroachments on our free will
and our habits and pursuits, and that fresh and more serious contests will arise
out of this beginning.</p>


<p><i>May 28th (day of the Derby).</i>&mdash;Yesterday on Epsom racecourse arrived the news
of Palmer's being found guilty of the murder of Cook. This case and the trial
have excited an interest almost unprecedented, unlike anything since the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> case
of Thurtell about twenty years ago or more. People who never heard of either of
the men took the deepest interest in it, the women particularly, though there
was nothing peculiar in it or of a nature to excite them particularly. The trial
lasted a fortnight, all the details of it were read with the greatest avidity,
half the town went one day or other to hear it, and the anxiety that the man
should be convicted was passionate. Cockburn gained great applause by the manner
in which he conducted the prosecution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEFEAT OF THE OPPOSITION.</div>

<p>This trial has proved more attractive and interesting than anything in the
political world, though there has been a pitched battle in the Lords on the
question of Maritime Law and Right of Search given up in the recent Treaty.
Derby made a violent onslaught on the Government, and was at first very
confident of a majority. He soon found these hopes were fallacious, when he got
angry and was more violent than he has ever been before this session. The
Government got a majority of above fifty, which puts an end to any further
contest there. The Government have now nothing to fear, the Opposition are
routed and dispirited, and one can see nothing to alter the present state of
affairs. The minor questions which have occupied attention are settling quietly.
The Chelsea Commission is over, and the result will be harmless, on the whole
rather good than bad, because it will prove that the violent attacks on the
military authorities during the war have been exaggerated and in many cases
unfounded. A sort of compromise has been made about the Wensleydale peerage, not
a very happy one, and it remains to be seen whether the House of Commons is
sufficiently acquiescent as to sanction it by agreeing to the 12,000<i>l.</i> a year
to be paid to two new judges and peers for life. The Government have virtually
abandoned the principle they contended for, and have yielded to the adverse vote
and Committee. When they appeal to Parliament and limit the number of life
peerages, they abandon the prerogative of the Crown.</p>


<p><i>June 1st.</i>&mdash;The state of affairs with America becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> more and more
alarming.<a name="FNanchor_1_4" id="FNanchor_1_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_4" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Grey told me the other night that he had had a long conversation
with Dallas, whose tone was anything but reassuring as to the prospect of peace;
and yesterday I met Thackeray, who is just returned from the United States. He
thinks there is every probability of the quarrel leading to war, for there is a
very hostile spirit, constantly increasing, throughout the States, and an
evident desire to quarrel with us. He says he has never met with a single man
who is not persuaded that they are entirely in the right and we in the wrong,
and they are equally persuaded if war ensues that they will give us a great
thrashing; they don't care for the consequences, their riches are immense, and
200,000 men would appear in arms at a moment's notice. Here, however, though
there is a great deal of anxiety, there is still a very general belief that war
cannot take place on grounds so trifling between two countries which have so
great and so equal an interest in remaining at peace with each other. But in a
country where the statesmen, if there are any, have so little influence, and
where the national policy is subject to the passions and caprices of an ignorant
and unreasoning mob, there is no security that good sense and moderation will
prevail. Many imagine that matters will proceed to the length of a diplomatic
rupture, that Crampton will be sent away and Dallas retire in consequence, and
that then by degrees the present heat will cool down, and matters be amicably
arranged without a shot being fired. I feel no such confidence, for if
diplomatic intercourse ceases numerous causes of complaint will arise, and as
there will be no means left for mutual and friendly explanation and adjustment,
such causes will be constantly exaggerated and inflamed into an irreconcileable
quarrel. Matters cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> long go on as they now are without the public here
becoming excited and angry, and the press on both sides insolent, violent, and
provoking, and at last, going on from one step to another, we shall find
ourselves drifted into this odious and on both parts suicidal contest, for there
is not a blow we can strike at America and her interests that will not recoil on
us and our own. It has often been remarked that civil wars are of all wars the
most furious, and a war between America and England would have all the
characteristics of a civil and an international contest; nor, though I have no
doubt that America is in the wrong, can I persuade myself that we are entirely
in the right on either of the principal points in dispute. We have reason to
congratulate ourselves that the Russian war is over, for if it had gone on and
all our ships had been in the Baltic, and all our soldiers in the Crimea,
nothing would have prevented the Americans from seizing the opportunity of our
hands being full to bring their dispute with us to a crisis.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_4" id="Footnote_1_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_4"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [In consequence of the dispute with the American Government on the
subject of Foreign Enlistment, Mr. Crampton, the British Minister, was ordered
to leave Washington on May 28th. He arrived in England on June 15th; but Lord
Palmerston stated in the House of Commons that the dismissal of Mr. Crampton did
not break off diplomatic relations with the United States, as Mr. Dallas
remained in this country. It is remarkable that within a few months or even
weeks two British Ministers received their passports from foreign governments
and were sent away&mdash;a very uncommon occurrence!]</p></div>


<div class="sidenote">MADAME RISTORI.</div>

<p><i>June 7th.</i>&mdash;I went last night to see the celebrated Ristori in a very bad play
called 'Medea,' being a translation into Italian from a French tragedy by a M.
Legouvï¿½. This play was written for Madame Rachel, who refused to act the part,
which refusal led to a lawsuit, in which the actress was (I think) defeated.
Ristori is certainly a fine actress, but she did not appear to me equal to Pasta
in the same part, or to other great actresses I have seen. However, my inability
to hear well and want of familiarity with Italian acting and imperfect knowledge
of the language disqualify me from being a competent judge.</p>

<p>The American horizon is rather less dark. Nothing is yet known as to Crampton's
dismissal, and Dallas does not believe it. The Danish Minister at Washington
writes over here that he thinks the clouds will disperse and there will be no
serious quarrel.</p>


<p><i>London, July 12th.</i>&mdash;After the lapse of a month and more, during which I could
not bring myself to record anything, or to comment upon passing events, I am at
last roused from my apathy, and am induced to take up my pen and say a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> word
upon the defeat of the Appellate Jurisdiction Bill in the House of Commons the
other night, which gave me the greatest satisfaction, because I regard it as a
just punishment for the stupid obstinacy with which the Government have
blundered on from one fault to another throughout this whole business. It has
been a complete comedy of errors, and every one who has taken a part in it has
been in the wrong. I told Granville how it would be in the first instance, and
urged him, after the House of Lords had refused to let in Parke as a life peer,
to accept the defeat quietly by making him an hereditary peer and thus give the
go-by to the main question. This nothing would induce them to do, and they
fancied that they could avoid the mortification of appearing to knock under, and
save their own consistency, by the contrivance of this bill. Every mischief that
it was possible to do they have managed to accomplish, and the leaders of the
opposite parties, who all felt themselves in a scrape, came to a sort of
compromise in the Lords' Committee, the result of which was this unpopular bill.
Amongst them they have assailed the prerogative of the Crown, they have damaged
the judicial authority of the House of Lords, they have deeply offended many of
their own friends by tendering to them such a measure, and they have behaved
most unkindly and unhandsomely to Baron Parke, who thinks he has great reason to
complain.</p>

<p>I have been at Knowsley for the last three days, and so missed the march of the
Guards into London on Wednesday. Lord Hardinge was struck down by paralysis as
he was speaking to the Queen at Aldershot on Tuesday last. It is supposed that
the Duke of Cambridge will succeed him, and that Jim Macdonald will be his
Military Secretary. The American question is still undecided, but everybody
appears to be very easy about it.</p>


<div class="sidenote">BARON PARKE ON THE LIFE PEERAGE.</div>

<p><i>July 20th.</i>&mdash;I met Baron Parke the other day, who talked over his affair,
complained of the treatment he had received from the Government, but said he
gathered from what the Chancellor had said to him that they meant now to make
him an hereditary peer, declared there was not a shadow of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> doubt about the
legality, and that Campbell had as little doubt as he himself had, but finding
the measure was unpopular with certain lawyers, he had suddenly turned against
his own recorded opinion and opposed it. The Baron said the Government were
greatly to blame for not having ventilated the question, and ascertained whether
they could carry it or not, and if he had had an idea of all the bother it had
made, he never would have had anything to do with it. George Lewis told me that
the life peerage had never been brought before the Cabinet, and he knew nothing
of it till he saw it in the Gazette, nor did Clarendon; in fact it was confined
to the Chancellor, Granville, and Palmerston. They none of them, however, know
with whom it originated. Now that the measure turns out to be so unpopular and
is so scouted, and the transaction has been attended with so many blunders and
defeats, no one is willing to accept the responsibility of it, or to acknowledge
having had anything to do with it. It is strange that Palmerston should ever
have consented to it, but he knew nothing and cared nothing about it; he was
probably assured it would go down without any difficulty, and in this <i>poco
curante</i> way he suffered himself to be committed to it, not seeing the storm it
would cause. He allowed Granville to manage it all his own way, and at last he
had the good luck to be beaten upon it in the House of Commons, for the scrape
would have been more serious if he had earned it there. These last days of the
session have been as usual marked by the withdrawal and abandonment of various
bills that were for the most part introduced at the beginning of it, and which
were found to be quite worthless, especially the Law Reform Bill.</p>


<p><i>London, July 27th.</i>&mdash;Parliament has finished its debates, and will be prorogued
on Tuesday. Dizzy wound up by a 'review of the session,' a species of
entertainment which used to be given annually some years ago by Lord Lyndhurst
with great skill and effect, but which on the present occasion, and in
Disraeli's hands, was singularly inopportune and ineffective. Lord Wensleydale
has at last taken his seat as an hereditary Peer; the Government, after various
abortive attempts to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> wriggle out of their absurd position, having done at last
what they ought to have done at first&mdash;knocked under and endured what could not
be cured. The Government go into summer and winter quarters in a very healthy
and prosperous state, with nothing apparently to apprehend, and with every
probability of meeting Parliament next year in the same condition, and, barring
accidents, going through next session as successfully as they have gone through
this.</p>


<p><i>August 4th.</i>&mdash;I was at Goodwood all last week; the Prince of Prussia came
there. Not a word of news; the Queen still engaged in reviewing the troops, and
complimentary fï¿½tes are still going on to Sir W. Williams of Kars, and Charles
Wyndham 'the hero of the Redan.' The disturbances in Spain seem to be over, and
O'Donnell remains victorious. My first impression was (the common one) that
Espartero had been ousted by an intrigue, and that it was a reactionary <i>coup
d'ï¿½tat</i>, but I now hear that it is no such thing, and that we ought to desire
the success of the present Government. Espartero and O'Donnell could not agree,
as was not unlikely in a coalition Government the two chiefs of which were men
of such different opinions and antecedents. After many abortive attempts to
reconcile their differences, it was agreed that a Council of Ministers should be
held which the Queen herself should preside over, and when a final attempt
should be made. A long discussion took place, and the Queen did all she could to
reconcile the two generals, and to enable the Government to go on unchanged.
Finding it impossible to effect this, she ended by saying, 'Well, gentlemen,
since I cannot prevail on you to go on together, I must needs choose between
you, and as I think Marshal O'Donnell will be the best able to carry on the
Government, I appoint him.' Then the National Guards began an insurrection which
was put down, but no violent measures seem to have been adopted, and O'Donnell
has declared that Spain can only be successfully governed on constitutional
principles, and that he means to retain the Cortes in its integrity. How far his
acts will correspond with his professions remains to be seen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> Narvaez was
recommended to go to France, and Queen Christina appears not to have been
allowed to return to Spain, which are good signs. It is a good thing for Spain
that Espartero should have retired, for though probably the honestest Spaniard,
he is at the same time the weakest and the most wanting in moral courage and
decision.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHANCES OF WAR.</div>

<p>History is full of examples of the slight and accidental causes on which the
greatest events turn, and of such examples the last war seems very full. Charles
Wyndham told me that nothing but a very thick fog which happened on the morning
of Inkerman prevented the English army being swept from their position and
totally discomfited. The Russians could see nothing, lost their own way, and
mistook the position of the British troops. Had the weather been clear so that
they had been able to execute their plans, we could not have resisted them; a
defeat instead of the victory we gained would have changed the destiny of the
world, and have produced effects which it is impossible to contemplate or
calculate.</p>

<p>On the other hand, nothing but miscalculation and bad management prevented the
capture of Sebastopol immediately after Alma. My nephew is just returned from a
voyage with Lord Lyons to the Crimea, where he went all over the scenes of the
late contest, all the positions, and the ruins of Sebastopol as well as the
northern forts. He was well treated by the Russians, who showed him everything,
and talked over the events of the war with great frankness. They told him that
if the allies had marched at once after the battle on the north side, no
resistance could have been made, and the other side must have fallen. We had
long known that the north side would have fallen if we had attacked it at once.
Frank asked the Russian officer whether there was any bad feeling on the part of
the Russian army towards the French or English, and he said none whatever, but a
great deal towards the Austrians, and that they desired nothing more than an
opportunity of fighting them. He also said that they had been misled by our
newspapers, from which they obtained all their information, and thinking that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
the announcements there of an intended invasion of the Crimea were made for the
purpose of deceiving them, they had withdrawn a great many troops from the
Crimea, so that while Sebastopol had been emptied of the garrison to increase
the army of Menschikoff, the Russians had not more than 30,000 or 35,000 men at
the Alma.</p>


<p><i>Hillingdon, August 17th.</i>&mdash;It is impossible to find anything of the least
interest to write about, and my journal is in danger of dying of starvation or
of atrophy. The causes of discontent we have had with Russia are disappearing,
and the Emperor's coronation will not be clouded by fresh <i>dolï¿½ances</i> on our
part. Bulwer is just gone to the Principalities, where the commissioners are to
endeavour to ascertain what are the wishes of the people as to the union. France
and England are in favour of it, Turkey and Austria against it, while Russia
professes to be indifferent and neutral. Spain is settling down into submission
to the Government of O'Donnell. Naples is relieved from her fears of English
intervention, and there seems some chance that she may relax the rigour of her
Government now that she may do so <i>salvo honore</i> and not under compulsion. This
country is profoundly tranquil and generally prosperous; everybody seems
satisfied with Palmerston and his administration. I myself, who for so many
years regarded him politically with the greatest aversion and distrust, have
come to think him the best minister we can have, and to wish him well.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CORONATION AT MOSCOW.</div>

<p><i>September 15th.</i>&mdash;Another month has passed away, and still I have had nothing
to record. The coronation at Moscow appears to have gone off with great <i>ï¿½clat</i>,
and to have been a spectacle of extraordinary magnificence, the prodigious cost
of which betrays no sign of exhaustion or impoverishment by the late war.<a name="FNanchor_1_5" id="FNanchor_1_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_5" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> We
were probably mistaken, as we were in so many other things, in fancying that the
power and resources of Russia were very greatly impaired, butduring the war,
whatever we wished we were ready to believe.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_5" id="Footnote_1_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_5"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [The Emperor Alexander II. of Russia was crowned with great pomp in
Moscow on September 7; the ceremony was attended by special ambassadors from all
the great Powers; Lord Granville, accompanied by Lady Granville and a brilliant
suite, was the representative of Great Britain on this occasion.]</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>The state of affairs at home and abroad is curious: abroad there is uneasiness
and uncertainty as to the future, the elements of future disturbances being in a
sort of abeyance; at home the fever and excitement which prevailed during the
war having been succeeded by a torpor and an apathy such as I never remember to
have seen before. All party politics seem to be extinct, the country cares about
nobody, desires no changes, and only wishes to go on and prosper. There is not a
public man to whom public opinion turns, and no great questions are afloat to
agitate and divide the country, or around the standards of which different
opinions, principles, or passions can flock. Palmerston may remain minister as
long as he lives, if he does not commit any gross faults either of commission or
of omission, or unless something may occur, which nobody can foresee or imagine,
to rouse the nation from its apathy.</p>


<p><i>September 21st.</i>&mdash;The old Crimean correspondent of the 'Times' has despatched a
very interesting and graphic account of the coronation at Moscow, and Granville
writes word that whereas he had estimated the cost of it at a million sterling,
he was now led to believe it would be not much less than three. The coronation
of George IV. cost 240,000<i>l.</i>, which was considered an enormous sum and a
monstrous extravagance. Our two last coronations cost from 30,000<i>l.</i> to
50,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The quarrel with the King of Naples appears to be coming to a crisis, and though
it will not produce any serious consequences now, the precedent of interference
we are establishing may have very important ones at some future time, and though
philanthropy may make us rejoice at some coercion being applied to put an end to
such a cruel and oppressive government as that of King Bomba (as they call
Ferdinand), it may be doubted whether it would not be sounder policy to abstain
from interference with what only indirectly and remotely concerns us, and from
enforcing a better and more humane system of government in a country where the
people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> do not seem to care much about its tyranny and inhumanity. And then
there is the great objection of dictating to and interfering with weak
governments while we do not venture to deal in the same way with the equally
flagrant abominations of stronger ones, to say nothing of a host of difficulties
and objections which suggest themselves as possible, if not probable, results of
our interference. It will afford to other Powers an excuse if not a right to
interfere in like manner, whenever they require a pretext, and they consider it
their interest to do so; and if such cases occur, the peace of the world will be
largely endangered. As it is, I strongly suspect (for I know nothing) that the
agreement on the Neapolitan question between France and ourselves is by no means
cordial and complete. Mrs. Craven writes me word she has been in a house in the
country with Walewski, who talked very openly (and no doubt imprudently) to her,
telling her that Palmerston was very difficult to go on with. I know not what
Palmerston has been doing, nor what his present policy may be, but I thought he
had either abandoned or greatly modified that old policy of meddling and
bullying to which he used to be so addicted, and at all events that while the
foreign policy of England is directed by Clarendon, we should abstain from
anything very arbitrary and violent. It is, however, whispered that Walewski is
no longer in the good graces of the Emperor, and what I heard long ago about Her
Majesty's opinion of him renders it not unlikely.</p>


<p><i>September 23rd.</i>&mdash;All the little I hear tends to confirm the notion that there
is an antagonism growing up between French and English policy, and that France
and Russia are becoming more and more intimate every day. The points of the
Treaty on which there are still some differences, and on which we appear to be
making a great fuss, the French seem to care very little about, perhaps being
rather disposed to side with Russia. These differences are very inconsiderable
in themselves, but if they lead to coolness and estrangement between us and the
French, and to an alliance between France and Russia, they may hereafter be very
important.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing can be more perplexed and unintelligible (at least to those who are not
behind the curtain) than the international relations of the Great Powers and of
their dispositions towards the smaller ones, and in such a chaos no little tact,
discretion, and firmness are required to shape our foreign policy.</p>


<div class="sidenote">M. GUIZOT ON DEMOCRACY IN ENGLAND.</div>

<p><i>September 25th.</i>&mdash;The void which the march of events fails to fill up cannot be
better occupied than by the following extract from Guizot's notice on Sir Robert
Peel in the '<i>Revue des Deux-Monde</i>s' (1856). He is speaking of democracy in
England:&mdash;'<i>M. de Talleyrand disait dans la Chambre des Pairs, il y a quelqu'un

Personne ne pourrait le dire, mais peu importe: pour ï¿½tre difficile ï¿½ dï¿½finir,
le fait n'en est ni moins certain, ni moins puissant, les ï¿½lï¿½ments les plus
divers entrent dans la composition de la dï¿½mocratie moderne, des classes riches
et des classes pauvres, des classes savantes et des classes ignorantes, des
maï¿½tres et des ouvriers, des conservateurs et des novateurs, des amis du pouvoir
et des enthousiastes de libertï¿½, bien des aristocrates mï¿½mes, dï¿½tachï¿½s de leur
origine par leurs m&oelig;urs, par leur aversion des gï¿½nes et des devoirs que
l'aristocratie impose. Et la position de la dï¿½mocratie anglaise n'est pas moins
changï¿½e que sa composition; elle ne se borne pas comme jadis ï¿½ dï¿½fendre au
besoin ses libertï¿½s, elle regarde les affaires publiques comme les siennes,

domine le gouvernement.</i>' All this seems to me perfectly true, and the best
definition of the English democracy, its nature, and its position that could
possibly be given, and that the nature of things admits of. Guizot evidently saw
clearly a truth which might be elaborated into a very interesting essay, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
which has often suggested itself to me, namely, that without any violence or
ostensible disturbances or any change in external forms, this country has
undergone as great a revolution as France itself, or any of the continental
nations which have been torn to pieces by civil discords and contests. If we
compare the condition of England at any two not very distant periods, and the
manner in which power and influence have been distributed at one and at the
other, this will be very apparent, and nobody can doubt that this process is
still going on. We are, as Guizot says, <i> 'dans une ï¿½poque de transition ...
sous l'empire des principes et des sentiments encore confus, perplexes et
obscurs, mais essentiellement dï¿½mocratiques, qui fermentent en Europe depuis
quinze siï¿½cles et y remportent de nos jours des victoires dont personne ne
saurait dire encore quel sera le vrai et dernier rï¿½sultat.'</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE QUARREL WITH NAPLES.</div>

<p><i>October 3rd.</i>&mdash;There appears to be a general feeling of uneasiness, almost of
alarm, as if something was impending to disturb the peace of the world and
interrupt the prosperity of nations, though nobody can very well tell what it is
they dread. The apprehension is vague, but it is general. The only political
question of any consequence in which we are concerned is that of Naples, and
some fancy that the Russian manifesto prognosticates a renewal of the contest
with that Empire. I have no such idea, but I am quite unable to comprehend what
it is the different Powers are about; there is a general impression, probably
not unfounded, that France and Russia are meditating a close alliance, and if
this be the truth, it is not likely that Russia should have put forth a State
paper offensive to France. It is by no means impossible that Gortschakoff may
have ascertained that the declaration of his Emperor's opinion would not be
distasteful to the Emperor Napoleon, who probably does not enter <i>con amore</i>
into this contest with Naples and merely does it to please us.<a name="FNanchor_1_6" id="FNanchor_1_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_6" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_6" id="Footnote_1_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_6"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [The British and French Governments had on more than one occasion
remonstrated with the King of Naples on the cruel and arbitrary policy of his
Government, which led eventually to his own destruction; but the King received
these remonstrances very ill, and on October 28 the differences between these
Courts had become so serious that the British and French Ministers were
withdrawn from Naples, and a naval squadron appeared off the city. The Russian
Government at this time issued a circular despatch complaining of these
proceedings of the Western Powers, and denying their right to interfere for the
purpose of extorting concessions from the King of Naples to his own subjects.]</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>When Baudin took leave of him at Paris the other day on his going to Russia, he
said to him, 'Is it your Majesty's wish that I should cultivate the most
friendly relations with the English Ministers at Moscow and Petersburg?' to
which the Emperor replied 'Certainly,' and <i>'L'Angleterre avant tout</i>.' In this
there can be little doubt of his personal sincerity, but probably his personal
disposition and the policy of his Government and the sentiments of the French
people do not altogether coincide, and this places him in a somewhat false
position, and will most likely lead to apparent vacillation and inconsistency in
his conduct.</p>

<p>Madame de Lieven writes to me that the Neapolitan Minister at Paris affirms that
his King will not give way at the dictation of the allied Powers. We do not,
however, as yet know what it is that is required of him. If it be true that he
should govern his people more mildly and liberally, nothing can be more vague,
and our greatest difficulties would begin when we had extorted from him promises
and engagements to act according to <i>our</i> notions of justice and humanity. He
would be more than mortal if he was disposed honestly to act up to engagements
and promises extorted from him by fear, and it would be impossible for us to
superintend and secure their due performance without taking upon ourselves
virtually the government of his kingdom and superseding the King's authority. We
never should get France to concur in this, and on the whole it appears more
probable that differences will arise in the course of this joint action between
us and France than that we should succeed in ameliorating the condition of
Naples. I fear the rage for interfering in the internal affairs of other
countries will never be extinguished here. I see in the papers to-day an address
to Clarendon from the Protestant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> Society, requesting he will interpose with the
Spanish Government in favour of some Spanish subject who has got into trouble in
consequence of having turned Protestant, and being engaged in diffusing the
Scriptures, and trying to convert others to Protestantism, which is an offence
against the laws of Spain.</p>


<p><i>October 7th.</i>&mdash;I have seen Clarendon and asked him about the affair of Naples.
He was not very communicative, and I suspect he is not very easy about the
course we are pursuing and the part he has to play. He first said that it was
impossible for us to tolerate the conduct of the King to us, and the
impertinence of his note. I asked what it was he said; Clarendon replied it
amounted to this, 'Mind your own business.' Then he alluded to the atrocities of
the Government, which ought not to be endured; that no man was safe for a
minute, or could tell when he went to bed at night that he might not be arrested
in the morning, all which was done by the King's personal orders; that there was
continual danger of an outbreak or insurrection, particularly of a Muratist
revolution. I told him my opinion of the very questionable policy of
interference, either as a matter of right or of expediency, and nothing could be
more lame than the case he made out. He said the ships were not to act any
hostile part, or to coerce the King, which makes the case worse in my opinion.
It is doing neither one thing nor the other, violating a sound principle, and
incurring great future risks without any present object, or effecting any good,
or benefiting the people in whom we take an interest. He says the Emperor
Napoleon has a great horror of a Muratist movement, the Prince Murat, his
cousin, being a most worthless blackguard; but his son, who married Berthier's
granddaughter and heiress, is a young man full of merit of every sort.</p>


<div class="sidenote">RUSSIAN INTRIGUE WITH FRANCE.</div>

<p><i>London, October 10th.</i>&mdash;I met Clarendon again at the Travellers', and had some
conversation with him, but was interrupted by Azeglio, or I might probably have
learnt more about the present state of affairs. He told me that we had been
squabbling with the French Government, and that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> persevering attempts of
Russia to disturb the harmony between us and them had not been unsuccessful.
Nothing in the way of cajolery had been omitted at Moscow to captivate the
French, while on one occasion the Emperor had been so uncivil that Granville
felt himself obliged to go to Gortschakoff and make a formal complaint, which
was met by all sorts of assurances and protestations in order to mollify him,
and after this everything went on smoothly. It is a curious state of things, for
as far as I can make it out, the policy of the French Government appears to be
to become intimate with Russia and to be cool with us; but all the time the
Emperor (who is the Government) shrinks from anything like a breach with
England, and clings to the intimacy established between the two Courts, and has
a profound respect for the Queen and value for her good opinion. I asked him how
he reconciled the offensive Circular of Gortschakoff with the anxiety of Russia
to please France, when he said that he had no doubt they had told the French
that it was aimed exclusively at <i>us</i>, and had come to an understanding with
Morny about it, so that France was not to take offence at it. We are now, he
said, on the best terms with Austria, and Austria on the worst with Russia.
Russia knows that the article of the treaty compelling her to surrender a part
of Bessarabia was the work of Austria, and this was an injury and an insult (for
she had never before disgorged territory) which she never would forgive. The
Russian Circular would have the effect of complicating the Neapolitan question,
as it made the King more resolved not to yield to the demands of the two Powers.
He told me that Palmerston had resolved to take up in earnest the question of
Law Reform next year, and that he (Clarendon) had strongly urged him to do so as
the best way of procuring both strength and credit for his Government; that
Palmerston had readily come into it, and was resolved to carry out those
measures which have so long been under discussion, and which for various reasons
have hitherto failed of their accomplishment.</p>


<p><i>November 10th.</i>&mdash;I went to The Grove on Saturday and had a good deal of
comfortable talk with Clarendon about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> foreign affairs, especially the Bolgrad
question and Naples. He described the former very clearly, and satisfied me that
we are entirely in the right. It was settled, he said, at Paris mainly between
him and Orloff. He drew the line on the map as the boundary had been agreed
upon, and as he was doing so, Orloff said, 'I wish you would draw it a little
more to the south; it will make no sort of difference to you, and by this means
it includes within our line a strip of territory which the Emperor wishes to
retain because it forms a part of a military colony which he is anxious to keep
intact;' and Clarendon agreed to draw the line accordingly and to accomplish the
Emperor's wishes. They have since attempted to quibble about another Bolgrad
which was not even marked at all on their map, and it turns out that the story
of the military colony was a mere pretence, as they have themselves given that
up without making any difficulty. The state of the case and the difference which
has since arisen with Russia and with France is this: the Emperor Napoleon, who
is very indolent and abhors the trouble of examining details, and consequently
remains often ignorant of what it behoves him to know, suffered himself to be
bamboozled by Brunnow and misled by Walewski into giving his assent to the
Russian interpretation of the boundary line, and to giving a promise of his
support in the controversy. Recently at Compiï¿½gne Cowley, in a long audience,
went through the whole question with him and minutely explained the case against
Russia. The Emperor said he had never really understood it before, acknowledged
that our case was good, regretted that he had committed himself, but said that
having pledged his word he did not know how to break that pledge and to withdraw
the support he had promised to give to Russia in the dispute, and this is the
fix in which the question now is. While the foolish and ignorant newspapers here
(except the 'Times') are endeavouring to separate the Emperor from his
ministers, and to make out that he is one with our Government, and that the
difficulties and obstructions proceed from other parties, the truth is that they
now proceed entirely from himself, worked upon and deceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> certainly by
Russian agents and pro-Russian ministers; but if he really was in the
disposition which our press attributes to him, he might break through such
obligations as he suffered himself to be entangled in and settle the question at
once; nor is it very easy to see why he does not, for there is good reason to
believe he is sincerely desirous of remaining on good terms with us. I asked
Clarendon why the question could not be again referred to a Conference of the
Powers parties to the Treaty, and he said we could not consent to this, because
we should be in a minority, for Sardinia, partly cajoled by Russia and partly
from antipathy to Austria, would go against us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISMISSAL OF NEAPOLITAN MINISTER.</div>

<p>I asked him about Naples, of which affair he could give but a very
unsatisfactory account and a lame story. He said France had acted with us very
steadily, but that it was she who had started this hare, and he had engaged in
it in the belief that the Emperor would never have mooted the question unless he
had been assured that the King of Naples would yield to the remonstrances of the
two Courts, and but for that conviction he would never have meddled in it, which
he now very much regretted. He had given Carini notice to quit, and at their
parting interview he had entreated him to persuade the King if possible to
change his system, and, now that he was relieved from all interference, menace,
or coercion, and his dignity could not suffer, to give satisfaction to all
Europe by putting an end to the inhuman and impolitic system, which had
occasioned our interference and had drawn upon him remonstrances and advice from
every Sovereign in Europe. Very good advice, and I hope it may be followed, but
it is a lame and impotent conclusion to the menacing demonstrations with which
we began to quarrel. Clarendon talked of the various atrocities of the King of
Naples, but with an evident consciousness that the fact, even if it be true, and
not, as is probable, exaggerated, affords no excuse for our policy in the
matter. As the subject could not be agreeable I did not press it, and abstained
from telling him how general the opinion is that he has committed a great
blunder. He will probably hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> enough of it before the chapter is closed; even
Granville, who never says much, said to me yesterday that 'it was a very foolish
affair.'</p>

<p>Clarendon talked to me of Palmerston, and told me (what I think I had heard, and
have very likely noted before) that on Aberdeen's fall Palmerston was quite
ready to join Derby when Derby tried to form a Government, and that it was
Clarendon's refusal which frustrated that attempt. Palmerston endeavoured to
persuade Clarendon to join, but when Clarendon put to him all the reasons why
they had both of them better refuse, Palmerston saw them all very clearly, and
rather imprudently said on leaving him, 'We are <i>both</i> agreed that it will not
do to have anything to do with Derby and his Government.' When Clarendon went to
the Queen and explained his own conduct to her, and she expressed to him the
embarrassment which she felt, and asked him what she could do, he at once said,
'Send for Lord Palmerston, who is the only man, in the present temper of the
people and state of affairs, who can form a Government that has a chance of
standing. Send for him at once, place yourself entirely in his hands, give him
your entire confidence, and I will answer for his conduct being all that you can
desire.' The Queen took the advice, and has had no reason to repent of it, and
Clarendon told me he had done everything in his power, and seized every
available opportunity to reconcile them to each other, to promote a good feeling
and understanding, and to soften any little asperities which might have made
their intercourse less smooth, and the consequence is that Palmerston gets on
with her very well, and his good sense as well as Clarendon's exhortations make
him see of what importance it is to him for the easy working of his Government
and his own ease to be on good and cordial terms with the Queen. It is therefore
really to Clarendon that Palmerston is indebted in great measure, if not
entirely, for being in his present position, but Clarendon has too much tact
ever to remind him of it, or of what he was himself inclined to do in 1855.</p>


<div class="sidenote">LEGAL APPOINTMENTS.</div>

<p><i>November 19th.</i>&mdash;The death of Jervis made the office of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> Chief Justice of
Common Pleas vacant.<a name="FNanchor_1_7" id="FNanchor_1_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_7" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> According to established (but as I think bad) usage, the
Attorney-General, Cockburn, had a right to take the place, and for the last
fortnight nothing occupied public attention more than the question whether he
would take it or not. He was much averse to take it, but everybody pressed him
to accept it, and after much hesitation and consultation he agreed to be Chief
Justice, and now it is said he regrets his determination and thinks he has made
a mistake. He gives up Parliament, for which he is well adapted, where he acts a
conspicuous part, being a capital speaker, and which he likes, and feels that it
is his element. He gives up the highest place at the bar, where he is a
successful advocate, and makes 15,000<i>l.</i> or 16,000<i>l.</i> a year, and he sees that
he shall be obliged to give up in great measure his loose habits and assume more
decorous behaviour, which will be a great sacrifice to him, and he becomes a
judge with 6,000<i>l.</i> a year for life, not being a good lawyer, and conscious
that he will be inferior to his colleagues and to the Puisne Judge in his own
court. As soon as he had consented to the promotion a fresh difficulty presented
itself as to the office of Solicitor-General, for such is the penury of legal
ability at this time that Westminster Hall cannot furnish any men of
unquestionable fitness for the office, and the difficulty is increased by the
choice being necessarily restricted to men holding the opinions of the present
Government, and being able to command a seat in Parliament. They have offered
the place to the Recorder, James Wortley, but up to this moment I know not if it
has been accepted.<a name="FNanchor_2_8" id="FNanchor_2_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_8" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_7" id="Footnote_1_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_7"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [Right Hon. Sir John Jervis, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, died

<p><i>November 23rd.</i>&mdash;After long delay and apparently much hesitation James Wortley
has accepted the Solicitor-Generalship. He consulted Gladstone and Sidney
Herbert, neither of them very eligible advisers on such a question. Gladstone is
said to have replied that he would run a great risk as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> his pecuniary
interests, but if he could support the foreign policy of the Government, there
was no reason why he should not accept. He retains his rank of Privy Councillor,
of which I doubt the fitness, as it places him at all events in a very anomalous
position, for the law officers are the official advisers of the Privy Council
and are often called upon to sit there as assessors. However, the Judges are
said to have pronounced an opinion that there is no reason why he should not
plead in any of the courts. It is said, and I believe truly, that now Cockburn
has taken the irretrievable step he is very sorry for it, and is more struck by
the necessary consequences of his promotion than he was at first. He has all his
life been a very debauched fellow, but he is clever, good-natured, and of a
liberal disposition and much liked by his friends. A story is told of him that
he was in the habit of going down on Sundays to Richmond or elsewhere with a
woman, and generally with a different one, and the landlady of the inn he went
to remembered that Sir A. Cockburn always brought Lady Cockburn with him, but
that she never saw any woman who looked so different on different days, and this
gave rise to another story. When Lord Campbell went to some such place with Lady
Stratheden (who had been raised to the peerage before her husband), the mistress
of the house said that Sir A. Cockburn always brought <i>Lady Cockburn</i> with him,
but that the Chief Justice brought another lady and not <i>Lady Campbell</i>.</p>

<p>While we have meetings perpetually held and innumerable writings put forth to
promote education and raise the moral standard of the people, we are horrified
and alarmed day after day by accounts of the most frightful murders, colossal
frauds, and crimes of every description. War has ceased, though the Temple of
Janus seems only to be ajar; but the world is still in commotion, in alarm, and
visited by every sort of calamity, moral and material, in the midst of which it
is difficult to discover any signs of the improvement of the human race, even of
those portions of it which are supposed to be the most civilised and the most
progressive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>


<div class="sidenote">A DIPLOMATIC IMBROGLIO.</div>

<p><i>December 7th.</i>&mdash;At Wrotham and at Ossington last week. The news of the day is
that we are to have another 'Conference' at Paris, to settle the Bolgrad affair,
our Government having given way to what Clarendon told me he certainly would not
consent; but we had managed to get matters into such a fix, and it was so
necessary to extricate all the several parties from the embarrassed positions in
which they were placed by their own or by each other's faults, that no
alternative remained. This arrangement, which is not very consistent with
Palmerston's recent declarations at Manchester and in London, is proclaimed by
the Government papers, and generally understood to be a means of enabling Russia
to concede our demands with as little loss of dignity and credit as possible,
and to terminate the difference between us and France by our making an apparent
concession to France, while she makes a real one to us. Everything has evidently
been carefully arranged for the playing out of this diplomatic farce, and
Cowley, who is to be our sole representative, is to be accommodating and not
quarrelsome; but <i>reste ï¿½ savoir</i> whether the man&oelig;uvres of some of the others
may not provoke his temper and bring about angry collisions. Between this matter
and the <i>bï¿½vue</i> we have made of our Neapolitan interference, never was there
such a deplorable exhibition as our foreign policy displays; but nobody seems to
care much about it, and though there will in all probability be a good deal of
sparring, and taunts and sneers in Parliament, Palmerston's Government will
incur no danger of any adverse vote, for everybody is conscious that in the
actual state of parties and the dearth of parliamentary leaders, every man of
sufficient ability being disqualified for one reason or another, no man but
Palmerston can conduct a Government or command a majority in Parliament; nor
does there appear in the distance any man likely to be able to fill his place in
the event of his death or his breaking down, events which must be contemplated
as not very remote when he is seventy-three years old, although his wonderful
constitution and superhuman vigour of mind and body make everybody forget his
age and regard the possibility of his demise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> with the sort of incredulity which
made the courtier of Louis XIV. exclaim on the death of that monarch, '<i>Aprï¿½s la
mort du Roi on peut tout croire.'</i></p>

<p>Great astonishment has been excited by the appointment of a Mr. Bickersteth as
Bishop of Ripon, against whom nothing can be said, nor anything for him, except
that he is a very Low Churchman. All the vacant sees have now been filled with
clergymen of this colour, which is not very fair or prudent, as it will
exasperate the moderate High Churchmen and set them strongly against a
Government which appears determined to shut the door of ecclesiastical
preferment against all but the Lowest Churchmen, and such a policy will most
likely have the effect of encouraging the advocates of those extreme measures of
an anti-Catholic or a puritanical character which always give so much trouble
and embarrassment when they are brought forward in Parliament.</p>


<p><i>December 12th.</i>&mdash;The Conference to which Clarendon told me he would not agree
is going to take place after all, but everybody is ridiculing what is
notoriously a got-up comedy with a foregone conclusion, devised to solve the
difficulty into which all the great actors had got themselves, but it is not yet
quite clear what the <i>modus operandi</i> is to be. From what I have picked up here
and there I gather that Sardinia is to be induced to give a casting vote against
Russia, leaving France still at liberty to fulfil her original engagement and
vote with her, while we obtain the object for which we have stood out, and by
such a <i>dodge</i> to bring the dispute to an end. When Parliament meets there will
be plenty to be said about this affair and about Naples, and no doubt the
Opposition or the malcontents will be able to bombard the Government and vent
their spleen, but that will be all, for Palmerston is perfectly invulnerable and
may commit any blunders with impunity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LEADERSHIP OF THE OPPOSITION.</div>

<p>A report has been lately current that Gladstone will become the leader of the
Opposition <i>vice</i> Disraeli, a report I thought quite wild and improbable, but I
heard the other day something which looks as if it was not so much out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> the
question as I had imagined. George Byng told me he had met Sir William Jolliffe,
who is the Derbyite whipper-in, at Wrotham, and having asked him whether there
was any foundation for the above report, he replied that it certainly was not
true at present, that he could not say what might or might not happen hereafter,
but that he could not at once be accepted as <i>leader</i>, and must in any case
first serve in the ranks. I do not know what may be the value of Jolliffe's
opinions, or what he knows of the intentions of his chief, but he may probably
be more or less acquainted with the sentiments of his party, and may be aware
that their necessities have modified their extreme repugnance to Gladstone, and
that they may now be willing to accept him as leader (eventually), though two
years ago they so peremptorily insisted on his entire exclusion from their
political society. Meanwhile there is no combination amongst them. Derby is at
Knowsley amusing himself, and Disraeli at Paris, doing nobody knows what.</p>

<p>There is talk of Lord Granville's resigning the lead and his office and going to
Ireland instead of Carlisle, or to Paris instead of Cowley, but he has never
intimated the least intention of doing either. Ireland he certainly will not go
to; Paris is not so impossible. There seems some doubt whether his health will
admit of his going on in the House of Lords, and if they knew how to get Cowley
away from Paris without doing him an injustice or an unkindness, I think they
would not be sorry, for his position there is unsatisfactory. It is a serious
inconvenience to be on such terms with Walewski that they never converse at all
except when business obliges them to meet, and the consequence of their
relations is that all affairs between the two countries are carried on between
Clarendon and Persigny in London, and as little as possible at Paris, because
the Emperor now fights rather shy of Cowley, and is by no means on the same
terms with him as heretofore, though always very civil and cordial enough when
they meet; and His Majesty will not part with Walewski, who, although of a
moderate capacity, is clever enough to know how to deal with his master,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> and
make himself agreeable to him, and the Emperor knows that if he were to change
his Minister for Foreign Affairs, it would be attributed to the influence of
England and be on that account unpopular. The English press has rendered
Walewski the incalculable service of making him popular in France, and rendering
it impossible for the Emperor to dismiss him, even if he had a mind to do so,
which he has not.</p>


<div class="sidenote">DICTATORIAL POLICY TO BRAZIL.</div>

<p><i>December 17th.</i>&mdash;There was an article in the 'Times' the day before yesterday
commenting in severe terms upon a transaction of our Foreign Office, as set
forth in a Blue Book, in relation to Brazil. It was the old subject of the slave
trade, and the old method of arrogant overbearing meddling and dictation, a case
as odious and unjust as any one of those by which Palmerston's foreign
administration has ever been disgraced. I really no longer recognise my old
friend Clarendon, in whose good sense and moderation I used to place implicit
confidence, and believed that he would inaugurate a system at the Foreign Office
very different from that of Palmerston, and which would tend to relieve us from
the excessive odium and universal unpopularity which Palmerston had drawn upon
us. It appears that I was mistaken. I told Granville yesterday morning what I
thought of this case, and asked him if it was correctly stated. He said he
regarded it just as I did, and that it was quite true, every word of it. I then
expressed my astonishment that Clarendon should have acted in this way, and he
replied, 'The fault of Clarendon is that he is always thinking of the effect to
be produced by Blue Books, and he looks after popularity, and is influenced by
those he acts with. Under Aberdeen he was very moderate, but he saw that the
moderation of Aberdeen made him unpopular, while Palmerston's popularity in
great measure arose from his very different manner towards other Powers, so when
Palmerston became Prime Minister instead of Aberdeen, he fell readily into the
Palmerstonian method.' I dare say this is the truth, and besides the contagion
of Palmerston himself, he is surrounded by men at the Foreign Office who are
prodigious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> admirers of Palmerston and of his slashing ways, and who no doubt
constantly urge Clarendon to adopt a similar style. All this is to me matter of
great regret personally, and it is revolting as to good taste, and, as I
believe, to our national interests. It is, however, a consolation to see that
the most powerful and influential of our journals has the courage, independence,
and good sense to protest publicly against such violent and unjustifiable
proceedings.</p>

<p><i>January 9th, 1857.</i>&mdash;The old year ended and the new year began strangely.
After three years of expensive war the balance-sheet exhibited such a state of
wealth and prosperity as may well make us 'the envy of surrounding nations;' but
while we have recovered the great blessing of peace, we have to look back upon a
year stained beyond all precedent with frightful crimes of every sort and kind:
horrible murders, enormous frauds, and scandalous robberies and defalcations.
The whole attention of the country is now drawn to the social questions which
press upon us with appalling urgency, and the next session of Parliament, which
is rapidly advancing, must be principally engaged in the endeavour to find
remedies for the evils and dangers incident to our corrupted population, and our
erroneous and inadequate penal system, the evils and dangers of which threaten
to become greater and more difficult to remedy every day. From this question it
is impossible to dissever that of education, for at least we ought to make the
experiment whether the diffusion of education will or will not be conducive to
the diminution of crime, and we shall see whether the sectarian prejudices, the
strength and obstinacy of which have hitherto erected im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>passable barriers to
the progress of educating the people, will retain all their obstinacy in the
face of the existing evil, or whether the bodily fear and the universal
persuasion of the magnitude and imminence of the danger will not operate upon
bigotry itself and render the masses more reasonable. Besides these important
questions the new year opens with a most unpleasant prospect abroad, where
everything seems to go wrong and our foreign relations, be the cause what, or
the fault whose it may, to be in a very unhappy state.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRUSSIA AND NEUFCHATEL.</div>

<p>The quarrel between Prussia and Switzerland<a name="FNanchor_1_9" id="FNanchor_1_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_9" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> is one in which we appear to have
no immediate interest, except that it is always our interest to prevent any
infraction of the general peace, but of course we could not think of not
interfering in some way or other in the matter. The King of Prussia has behaved
as ill and as foolishly as possible, and our Government entirely disapprove of
his conduct and have given the Swiss to understand that all our sympathies are
with them, and that we think they have right on their side. If France and
England were now on really good terms, and would act together with cordiality
and authority, nothing would be so easy as to put a prompt extinguisher on the
Swiss affair; but as we cannot agree upon a common course of action, there is
danger of the dispute drifting into a war, though it is evidently so much the
interest and the desire of the Emperor Napoleon to allow no shots to be fired,
that I still expect, even at this almost the eleventh hour, to be in a complete
fix. The Swiss will not release the prisoners unless the King will at the same
time abandon his claims on Neufchï¿½tel, or unless England and France will
guarantee that he will do so. The King will do nothing and agree to nothing
unless the Swiss will previously and unconditionally release the prisoners, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
moreover he repudiates our intervention, as he thinks us unfairly disposed to
himself. The simplest course would be for England and France to declare that a
Prussian invasion of Switzerland should be a <i>casus belli</i>, and I think we
should have no objection to this, but France won't go along with us. Then if the
Swiss should deliver over the prisoners to France, and she would accept the
depï¿½t, all might be settled. As it is, we have backed up Switzerland to resist,
and if war ensues we shall leave her to her fate&mdash;a very inglorious course to
pursue; and although I have a horror of war, and am alive to the policy of
keeping well with France, I am inclined to think that having encouraged the
Swiss to a certain point it would better become us to take our own independent
line and to threaten Prussia with war if she does not leave Switzerland alone,
than to sit tamely by and see her, unimpeded, execute her threats. The
Government are evidently much embarrassed by this question, which is still
further complicated by the matrimonial engagement between the two Royal
families.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_9" id="Footnote_1_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_9"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [The Prussian Crown retained, by the Treaty of Vienna, rights of
sovereignty over the Swiss Canton of Neufchï¿½tel, and appointed a Governor there.
In other respects the Neufchï¿½telese enjoyed all the rights and liberties of
Swiss citizens. This anomalous state of things naturally gave rise to friction.
The King of Prussia derived no sort of advantage from his nominal sovereignty;
but as a matter of dignity he declined to renounce it, and even threatened a
military occupation of the Canton, which the Swiss Confederation would have
resisted.]</p></div>


<p><i>January 13th.</i>&mdash;The Swiss affair seems settled, so far at least that there will
be no war. The prisoners will be released, but I dare say the King of Prussia
will <i>chicaner</i> about the abdication of his rights over Neufchï¿½tel. All the
world is occupied with Sir Robert Peel's speech, or lecture as he terms it, at
Birmingham, where he gave an account, meant to be witty, of his <i>sï¿½jour</i> in
Russia and its incidents. It was received with shouts of applause by a congenial
Brummagem audience, and by deep disapprobation in every decent society and by
all reasonable people.</p>


<p><i>January 14th.</i>&mdash;I met Clarendon last night, who told me the Swiss question was
still in doubt, for the King was shuffling and would probably play them a trick,
and though he knew the prisoners were going to be liberated, he would not engage
positively to give up his claim. The Emperor Napoleon has behaved very ill and
ungratefully to the Swiss, who in consequence were more irritated against him
than against the King of Prussia himself. Nothing could equal the fawning
flattery and servility of the King to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> Emperor, who was at the same time
tickled by it and disgusted.</p>


<div class="sidenote">LORD ABERDEEN AND LORD JOHN RUSSELL.</div>

<p><i>January 20th.</i>&mdash;At Woburn for two days. I found the Duke entirely occupied with
a question (on which he had of course a various correspondence), whether when
Aberdeen's Government was formed, Aberdeen had <i>at the time</i> imparted to John
Russell his wish and intention to retire as soon as possible, so that John might
take his place as Premier. To ascertain this fact, he had applied to Lord John
and Aberdeen, to Lansdowne and to Clarendon, all of whom he invited to send him
their recollections and impressions, which they did. The matter now is not of
much importance, but is worth noticing from the evidence it affords of the
difficulty of arriving at truth, and therefore of the fallibility of all
history. Though this circumstance is so recent, and at the time was so
important, not one of the parties, neither Lord John nor Aberdeen nor the other
two, can recollect what did pass, but as they all concur in their impressions
that no such engagement was given when the Government was formed, it may safely
be concluded that this is the truth. I know I heard all that passed, and
certainly I never heard of any such intention, though I did hear some time
afterwards that such had been Aberdeen's expressed wish and Lord John's
expectation. I read Aberdeen's letters, in which he entered into other matters
connected with his Government, and I must say more creditable, gentlemanlike,
and amiable letters I never read.</p>


<p><i>January 28th.</i>&mdash;At Stoke from Saturday to Monday. On returning to town, we
heard that the Persian war was over, Palmerston's usual luck bringing a
settlement of the only question that could be embarrassing on the eve of the
meeting of Parliament. But the news only comes telegraphically, so unless
confirmed must be doubtful, and cannot be named in the Speech.<a name="FNanchor_1_10" id="FNanchor_1_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_10" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_10" id="Footnote_1_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_10"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [Differences had arisen in the spring of 1856 between Great Britain

landed at Bushire on January 27, 1857, and the Persians were defeated at Kooshab
on February 8. Peace was signed in Paris between Her Majesty and the Shah on
March 4, the Persians engaging to abstain from all interference in the internal
affairs of Afghanistan, and to respect the independence of Herat. If these dates

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF PRINCESS LIEVEN.</div>

<p>Two remarkable deaths have occurred, one of which touches me nearly, that of
Madame de Lieven; the other is that of the Duke of Rutland. Madame de Lieven
died, after a short illness, of a severe attack of bronchitis, the Duke having
lingered for many months. Very different characters. Madame de Lieven came to
this country at the end of 1812 or beginning of 1813 on the war breaking out
between Russia and France. Pozzo di Borgo had preceded the Lievens to renew
diplomatic relations and make arrangements with us. She was at that time young,
at least in the prime of life, and though without any pretensions to beauty, and
indeed with some personal defects, she had so fine an air and manner, and a
countenance so pretty and so full of intelligence, as to be on the whole a very
striking and attractive person, quite enough so to have lovers, several of whom
she engaged in succession without seriously attaching herself to any. Those who
were most notoriously her slaves at different times were the present Lord
Willoughby, the Duke of Sutherland (then Lord Gower), the Duke of Cannizzaro
(then Count St. Antonio), and the Duke of Palmella, who was particularly clever
and agreeable. Madame de Lieven was a <i>trï¿½s grande dame</i>, with abilities of a
very fine order, great tact and <i>finesse</i>, and taking a boundless pleasure in
the society of the great world and in political affairs of every sort. People
here were not slow to acknowledge her merits and social excellence, and she
almost immediately took her place in the cream of the cream of English society,
forming close intimacies with the most conspicuous women in it, and assiduously
cultivating relations with the most remarkable men of all parties. These
personal <i>liaisons</i> sometimes led her into political partisanship not always
prudent and rather inconsistent with her position, character, and functions
here. But I do not believe she was ever mixed up in any intrigues, nor even, at
a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> later period, that she was justly obnoxious to the charge of caballing and
mischief-making which has been so lavishly cast upon her. She had an insatiable
curiosity for political information, and a not unnatural desire to make herself
useful and agreeable to her own Court by imparting to her Imperial masters and
mistresses all the information she acquired and the anecdotes she picked up.
Accordingly while she was in England, which, was from 1812 to 1834, she devoted
herself to society, not without selection, but without exclusion, except that
she sought and habitually confined herself to the highest and best. The Regent,
afterwards George IV., delighted in her company, and she was a frequent guest at
the Pavilion, and on very intimate terms with Lady Conyngham, for although
Madame de Lieven was not very tolerant of mediocrity, and social and colloquial
superiority was necessary to her existence, she always made great allowances for
Royalty and those immediately connected with it. She used to be a great deal at
Oatlands, and was one of the few intimate friends of the Duchess of York,
herself very intelligent, and who therefore had in the eyes of Madame de Lieven
the double charm of her position and her agreeableness. It was her duty as well
as her inclination to cultivate the members of all the successive Cabinets which
passed before her, and she became the friend of Lord Castlereagh, of Canning,
the Duke of Wellington, Lord Grey, Lord Palmerston, John Russell, Aberdeen, and
many others of inferior note, and she was likewise one of the <i>habituï¿½s</i> of
Holland House, which was always more or less neutral ground, even when Lord
Holland was himself a member of the government. When Talleyrand came over here
as Ambassador, there was for some time a sort of antagonism between the two
embassies, and particularly between the ladies of each, but Madame de Dino (now
Duchesse de Sagan) was so clever, and old Talleyrand himself so remarkable and
so agreeable, that Madame de Lieven was irresistibly drawn towards them, and for
the last year or two of their being in England they became extremely intimate;
but her greatest friend in England was Lady Cowper, afterwards Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> Palmerston,
and through her she was also the friend of Palmerston, who was also well
affected towards Russia, till his jealous and suspicious mind was inflamed by
his absurd notion of her intention to attack us in India, a crotchet which led
us into the folly and disaster of the Afghan war. In 1834 the Lievens were
recalled, and she was established at St. Petersburg in high favour about the
Empress, but her <i>sï¿½jour</i> there was odious to her, and she was inconsolable at
leaving England, where after a residence of above twenty years she had become
rooted in habits and affections, although she never really and completely
understood the country. She remained at St. Petersburg for several months, until
her two youngest children were taken ill, and died almost at the same time. This
dreadful blow, and the danger of the severe climate to her own health, gave her
a valid excuse for desiring leave of absence, and she left Russia never to
return. She went to Italy, where M. de Lieven died about the year 1836 or 1837,
after which she established herself in Paris, where her salon became the
rendezvous of the best society, and particularly the neutral ground on which
eminent men and politicians of all colours could meet, and where her tact and
adroitness made them congregate in a sort of social truce.</p>

<p>I do not know at what exact period it was that she made the acquaintance of M.
Guizot, but their intimacy no doubt was established after he had begun to play a
great political part, for his literary and philosophical celebrity would not
alone have had much charm for her. They were, however, already great friends at
the time of his embassy to England, and she took that opportunity of coming here
to pay a visit to her old friends. The fall of Thiers' Government and Guizot's
becoming Minister for Foreign Affairs of course drew Madame de Lieven still more
closely to him, and during the whole of his administration their alliance
continued to be of the closest and most intimate character. It was an immense
object to her to possess the entire confidence of the French Minister for
Foreign Affairs, who kept her <i>au courant</i> of all that was going on in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> the
political world, while it is not surprising that he should be irresistibly
attracted by a woman immensely superior to any other of his acquaintance, who
was fully able to comprehend and willing to interest herself about all the grand
and important subjects which he had to handle and manage, and who associated
herself with a complete sympathy in all his political interests. Their
<i>liaison</i>, which some people consider mysterious, but which I believe to have
been entirely social and political, grew constantly more close, and every moment
that Guizot could snatch from the Foreign Office and the Chamber he devoted to
Madame de Lieven. He used to go there regularly three times a day on his way to
and his way from the Chamber, when it was sitting, and in the evening; but while
he was by far her first object, she cultivated the society of all the most
conspicuous and remarkable people whom she could collect about her, and she was
at one time very intimate with Thiers, though his rivalry with Guizot and their
intense hatred of each other eventually produced a complete estrangement between
her and Thiers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARACTER OF PRINCESS LIEVEN.</div>

<p>The revolution of 1848 dispersed her friends, broke up her salon, and terrified
her into making a rather ludicrous, but as it turned out wholly unnecessary,
escape. She came to England, where she remained till affairs appeared to be
settled in France and all danger of disturbance at an end. She then returned to
Paris, where she remained, not without fear and trembling, during the period of
peril and vicissitude which at length ended, much to her satisfaction, with the
<i>coup d'ï¿½tat</i> and the Empire. Guizot had returned to Paris, but constantly
refused to take any part in political affairs, either under the Republic or with
the new government of Louis Napoleon. This, however, did not prevent Madame de
Lieven (though their friendship continued the same) from showing her sympathy
and goodwill to the Imperial <i>rï¿½gime</i>, and her salon, which had been decimated
by previous events, was soon replenished by some of the ministers or adherents
of the Empire, who, though they did not amalgamate very well with her old
<i>habituï¿½s</i>, supplied her with interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> information, and subsequently, when
the war broke out, rendered her very essential service. When the rupture took
place all the Russian subjects were ordered to quit Paris. She was advised by
some of her friends to disobey the order, for as she was equally precluded from
going to England, the circumstances in which this order placed her were
indescribably painful and even dangerous, but she said that however great the
sacrifice, and though she was entirely independent, she was under so many
obligations and felt so much attachment to the Imperial family that, cost her
what it might, she would obey the order, and accordingly she repaired to
Brussels, where for a year and a half or two years she took up her melancholy
and uncomfortable abode. At last this banishment from her home and her friends,
with all the privations it entailed, became insupportable, and she endeavoured,
through the intervention of some of her Imperialist friends, to obtain leave of
the French Government to return to Paris, either with or without (for it is not
clear which) the consent of her own Court. The Emperor Napoleon seems to have
been easily moved to compassion, and signified his consent to her return. No
sooner did this become known to Cowley and the English Government than they
resolved to interpose for the purpose of preventing her return to Paris, and
Cowley went to Walewski and insisted that the Emperor's permission should be
revoked. The <i>entente cordiale</i> was then in full force, nothing could be refused
to the English Ambassador, and Madame de Lieven was informed that she must not
come back to Paris. She bore this sad disappointment with resignation, made no
complaints, and resolved to bide her time. Some months later she caused a
representation to be made to the French Government that the state of her health
made it impossible for her to pass another winter at Brussels, and that she was
going to Nice, but as it was of vital importance to her to consult her medical
adviser at Paris, she craved permission to proceed to Nice <i>viï¿½</i> Paris, where
she would only stay long enough for that purpose. The permission was granted.
She wrote me word that she was going to Paris to remain there a few days. I
replied that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> I was much mistaken in her if once there she ever quitted it
again. She arrived and was told by her doctor that it would be dangerous in her
state to continue her journey. She never did proceed further, and never did quit
Paris again. The Government winked at her stay, and never molested or interfered
with her. She resumed her social habits, but with great caution and reserve, and
did all she could to avoid giving umbrage or exciting suspicion. It was a proof
of the greatness of her mind, as well as of her prudence and good temper, that
she not only testified no resentment at the conduct of Cowley towards her, but
did all she could to renew amicable relations with him, and few things annoyed
her more than his perseverance in keeping aloof from her. From the time of her
last departure from England up to the death of Frederic Lamb (Lord Beauvale and
Melbourne) she maintained a constant correspondence with him. After his death
she proposed to me to succeed him as her correspondent, and for the last two or
three years our epistolary commerce was intimate and unbroken. She knew a vast
deal of the world and its history during the half century she had lived and
played a part in it, but she was not a woman of much reading, and probably at no
time had been very highly or extremely educated, but her excessive cleverness
and her <i>finesse d'esprit</i> supplied the want of education, and there was one
book with which her mind was perpetually nourished by reading it over and over
again. This was the 'Letters of Madame de Sï¿½vignï¿½,' and to the constant study of
those unrivalled letters she was no doubt considerably indebted for her own
epistolary eminence, and for her admirable style of writing, not, however, that
her style and Madame de Sï¿½vignï¿½'s were at all alike. She had not (in her letters
at least) the variety, the abundance, or the <i>abandon</i> of the great Frenchwoman,
but she was more terse and epigrammatic, and she had the same graphic power and
faculty of conveying much matter in few words.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRINCESS LIEVEN.</div>

<p>Nothing could exceed the charm of her conversation or her grace, ease, and tact
in society. She had a nice and accurate judgement, and an exquisite taste in the
choice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> her associates and friends; but though taking an ardent pleasure in
agreeableness, and peculiarly susceptible of being bored, she was not
fastidious, full of politeness and good breeding, and possessed the faculty of
turning every one to account, and eliciting something either of entertainment or
information from the least important of her acquaintance. It has been the
fashion here, and the habit of the vulgar and ignorant press, to stigmatise
Madame de Lieven as a mischievous intriguer, who was constantly occupied in
schemes and designs hostile to the interests of our country. I firmly believe
such charges to be utterly unfounded. She had resided for above twenty years,
the happiest of her life, in England, and had imbibed a deep attachment to the
country, where she had formed many more intimacies and friendships than she
possessed anywhere else, and to the last day of her life she continued to
cherish the remembrance of her past connexion, to cultivate the society of
English people, and to evince without disguise her predilection for their
country. She had never lived much in Russia, her connexion with it had been
completely dissolved, and all she retained of it was a respectful attachment to
the Imperial family, together with certain sympathies and feelings of loyalty
for her native country and her Sovereign which it would have been unnatural and
discreditable to disavow. Her well-known correspondence with the Imperial Court
was only caused by the natural anxiety of those great persons to be kept <i>au
courant</i> of social and political affairs by such an accomplished correspondent,
but I do not believe she was ever employed by them in any business or any
political design; on the contrary, she was rather distrusted and out of favour
with them, on account of her being so denaturalised and for her ardent affection
for England and the English. Russia was the country of her birth, France the
country of her adopted abode, but England was the country of her predilection.
With this cosmopolite character she dreaded everything which might produce
hostile collision between any two of these countries. She was greatly annoyed
when the question of the Spanish marriages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> embittered the relations between
France and England, but infinitely more so at the Turkish quarrel, and the war
which it produced. Those who fulminated against her intrigues were, as I
believe, provoked at the efforts she made, so far as she had any power or
influence, to bring about the restoration of peace, an unpardonable offence in
the eyes of all who were bent on the continuation of the war. She lived to see
peace restored, and closed her eyes almost at the moment that the last seal was
put to it by the Conference of Paris. Her last illness was sudden and short. Her
health had always been delicate, and she was very nervous about herself; an
attack of bronchitis brought on fever, which rapidly consumed her strength, and
brought her, fully conscious, within sight of death; that consummation, which at
a distance she had always dreaded, she saw arrive with perfect calmness and
resignation, and all the virtues and qualities for which the smallest credit was
given her seem to have shone forth with unexpected lustre on her deathbed. Her
faculties were bright and unclouded to the last, her courage and presence of
mind were unshaken, she evinced a tender consideration for the feelings of those
who were lamenting around her bed, and she complied with the religious
obligations prescribed by the Church of which she was a member with a devotion
the sincerity of which we have no right to question. She made her son Paul and
Guizot leave her room a few hours before she died, that they might be spared the
agony of witnessing her actual dissolution, and only three or four hours before
the supreme moment, she mustered strength to write a note in pencil to Guizot
with these words: '<i>Merci pour vingt annï¿½es d'amitiï¿½ et de bonheur. Ne m'oubliez
pas, adieu, adieu!</i>' It was given to him after her death.</p>


<div class="sidenote">A SERMON BY MR. SPURGEON.</div>

<p><i>February 8th.</i>&mdash;I am just come from hearing the celebrated Mr. Spurgeon preach
in the Music Hall of the Surrey Gardens. It was quite full; he told us from the
pulpit that 9,000 people were present. The service was like the Presbyterian:
Psalms, prayers, expounding a Psalm, and a sermon. He is certainly very
remarkable, and undeniably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> a very fine character; not remarkable in person, in
face rather resembling a smaller Macaulay, a very clear and powerful voice,
which was heard through the whole hall; a manner natural, impassioned, and
without affectation or extravagance; wonderful fluency and command of language,
abounding in illustration, and very often of a very familiar kind, but without
anything either ridiculous or irreverent. He gave me an impression of his
earnestness and his sincerity; speaking without book or notes, yet his discourse
was evidently very carefully prepared. The text was 'Cleanse me from my secret
sins,' and he divided it into heads, the misery, the folly, the danger (and a
fourth which I have forgotten) of secret sins, on all of which he was very
eloquent and impressive. He preached for about three-quarters of an hour, and,
to judge of the handkerchiefs and the audible sobs, with great effect.</p>

<p>We have had a week of Parliament, and though nothing important has occurred, the
discussions do not seem to have raised the reputation of the Government or to
promise them an easy session, though nobody seems to expect that their stability
is likely to be shaken. Disraeli and Gladstone seem verging towards each other
in opposition, but there is no appearance of a coalition between them; the only
striking fact is that the Opposition, of whose disunion we have heard so much,
and of the internal repulsion supposed to prevail among them, seems to be as
united as ever it has been, and the usual people appeared at Derby's and
Disraeli's gatherings. I take it that any appearance of vulnerability of the
Government silences all manifestations of their mutual antipathies, and puts
them on the <i>qui vive</i> to turn out their opponents.</p>

<p>Gladstone seems bent on leading Sir George Lewis a weary life, but Lewis is just
the man to encounter and baffle such an opponent, for he is cold-blooded as a
fish, totally devoid of sensibility or nervousness, of an imperturbable temper,
calm and resolute, laborious and indefatigable, and exceedingly popular in the
House of Commons from his general good humour and civility, and the credit given
him for honour, sincerity, plain dealing, and good intentions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>


<p><i>February 11th.</i>&mdash;The Duke of Bedford told me yesterday that Clarendon had
complained to him bitterly of John Russell's speech the first night of the
session, of the hostility it manifested, and particularly of what he said about
Naples. On looking at the report of the speech, the Neapolitan part was
certainly strong, but it was not stronger than was warranted by the
circumstances of the case, and there seems no reason why Lord John should
abstain from speaking out his opinions fairly on any important point of foreign
policy. His speech, on the whole, was not regarded as hostile or acrimonious.
Disraeli has got into a scrape by blurting out an accusation which he has
entirely failed in making good, and he has afforded Palmerston an occasion for a
triumph over him not a little damaging. I am told the effect in the House was
very bad for Disraeli. Palmerston is said to be beginning to show some symptoms
of physical weakness, which if it be so, is very serious at the beginning of a
long and arduous session. He is rising seventy-three, and at that age, and
loaded with the weight of public affairs, it is not wonderful if the beginning
of the end should be discernible.</p>


<div class="sidenote">TREATY BETWEEN FRANCE AND AUSTRIA.</div>

<p><i>February 14th.</i>&mdash;The defeat which Disraeli sustained the other night was turned
the night before last into something like a triumph, and Palmerston found
himself in a disagreeable position. Disraeli had asserted that a Treaty had been
concluded between France and Austria for certain ends and at a certain time.
Palmerston flatly contradicted him, and with great insolence of manner,
especially insisting that it was nothing but a Convention, and that conditional,
which <i>never had been signed</i>. Two nights after Palmerston came down to the
House, and in a very jaunty way said he must correct his former statement, and
inform the House he had just discovered that the Convention <i>had been signed</i>.
Great triumph naturally on the part of Disraeli, who poured forth a rather
violent invective. Then Palmerston lost his temper and retorted that Disraeli
was trying to cover an ignominious retreat by vapouring. This language, under
the circumstances of the case, was very imprudent and very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> improper, and
(unlike what he had ever experienced before) he sat down without a single cheer,
his own people even not venturing to challenge the approbation of the House in a
matter in which, though Disraeli was not right, Palmerston was so clearly wrong.
What business had he to make such a mistake? for he ought to have been perfectly
and accurately informed of every detail connected with foreign affairs. He
certainly is not <i>qualis erat</i>, and I am disposed to believe that he is about to
begin breaking, and that he will not be able to go through a long and arduous
session with the same vigour and success which he has hitherto manifested. Every
sign and symptom of weakness and failing strength which he may show will raise
the hopes and stimulate the exertions of the Opposition, and we may expect to
see not a coalition, but such a concurrence between Gladstone, Disraeli, and
Lord Stanley as will prevent the possibility of an alternative Government.
Gladstone and Disraeli are already on friendly terms, and Gladstone and Stanley
seem to be still more intimate. The present Government only exists by
Palmerston's personal popularity, and it would not require much to pull that
down.</p>


<p><i>February 17th.</i>&mdash;I called on Lyndhurst on Sunday. He was in high force, with
the Blue Book before him, getting up the China case, on which he means to have a
day in the House of Lords. He told me that Gladstone says the Budget is the
worst that was ever produced, and he stakes his credit on proving that it is
full of errors from beginning to end, that, instead of a present surplus of
nearly a million, there is a present deficit of four millions, and that there
will be one of nine millions in 1860. I don't believe he will make his words
good.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DIFFICULT RELATIONS WITH FRANCE.</div>

<p>I saw Clarendon yesterday morning, and found him low, worn, and out of sorts;
said he wished to Heaven he could be delivered from office; everything went
wrong, the labour, anxiety, and responsibility were overwhelming, and the
difficult state of our relations with France more than could be endured. He
could not depend on the French Government, and never knew from one day to
another what the conse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>quences of their conduct might be. He believed the
Emperor sincerely desired to keep well with us, but his Government were
constantly doing things which rendered our acting together and cordially almost
impossible; that his excessive levity and carelessness perpetually made him the
dupe of other people, and led him into saying things and committing himself, and
then he did not know how to get out of the engagements to which he stood
committed. Clarendon added that it was impossible such a state of things should
not produce first coolness and then quarrels, and then God knows what
consequences, and he was obliged to pick his way through the embarrassments that
spring up around him with the utmost care and circumspection. Palmerston, who
never saw difficulties, took it with his usual easy way, and said we were not
tied to France like Siamese Twins, and why should we care so much what she did,
and why might she not take her way, and we ours; but Clarendon feels that it is
impossible for him, on whom the responsibility is more immediately thrown, to
take a matter fraught with such consequences in so easy a style; that if any
serious dispute arose, France and Russia would probably become allied against
us, and that America would join them. Russia pays the most unceasing and the
most abject court to Louis Napoleon, and not without success. He (Clarendon)
said nothing could be worse than the conduct of the French Government about the
affair of the Principalities, which was of vital importance to Austria, who
threatened (though she would not keep her resolution) to make it a <i>casus belli</i>
if it is insisted on. He said Austria had behaved very well about the amnesty in
Italy, and was going to do the same thing in Hungary. We were interrupted as
usual in our conversation, and I had not time to ask him about many things I
wanted to hear of. I told him I thought the China case was a very bad one.</p>

<p>John Russell seems to me to be drifting into hostility to the Government more
and more. He made a strong, but very just, speech on Naples the first night,
which irritated Clarendon very much. A few nights ago he said something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> in the
House about China, and backed up the Government against Roebuck, at which
Clarendon expressed great satisfaction, and evinced a disposition to seize that
pretext to put himself on good terms with Lord John, but Lord John showed no
readiness to meet the overture, and when the Duke of Bedford wrote to him what
Clarendon had said, he replied that Clarendon owed him nothing, for he had said
what he thought right and not what he thought would be agreeable to him, and
that it was very probable he should say something he would not at all like
before long.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning the Judicial Committee finished the case of Liddell and
Westerton, after eight days of elaborate argument, and a powerful case was made
in appeal against Lushington's judgement, which I expect to see reversed, and I
hope it will, for I detest the proceedings of the people who back up Mr.
Westerton, who would drag down the Church to a puritanical level, and strip it
of its splendour.</p>


<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF LORD ELLESMERE.</div>

<p><i>February 19th.</i>&mdash;Yesterday morning, at half-past twelve o'clock, my
brother-in-law Lord Ellesmere, expired at Bridgewater House, after an illness of
three months. He was surrounded by all his family, and died most peacefully, and
without any suffering, and in possession of his mental powers till within a few
hours of his death. Few men have quitted this world more beloved, respected, and
lamented than this excellent person. He had just completed the fifty-seventh
year of his age, so might naturally have been expected to live many years, and
till he was taken ill, little more than three months ago, he appeared to be in
his usual state of health and likely to have a long and enjoyable existence
before him. It is no exaggeration to say that he was most estimable in every
relation of life, and as such he enjoyed universal respect and regard. He never
at any time played a conspicuous part in politics, for which he had neither
ambition nor the necessary qualifications, but in such part as he was
occasionally called upon to take, he acted with propriety and general
approbation. But he had no taste for the turmoil of political life, and his
temper was too serene and his love of repose too great to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> allow him to plunge
deeply in political warfare. His abilities were not of a very high order, but he
had a good understanding, a cultivated mind, and an inquisitive disposition, and
though not profound in any branch of literature or science, he loved to wander
over the vast fields of knowledge, so that he was stored with much superficial
information on a great variety of subjects. His taste was good both in
literature and art; he was an elegant poet, and a fair writer of his own tongue;
he was naturally kind-hearted and charitable, more particularly to meritorious
artists who stood in need of assistance, by whom his loss will be severely felt.
All his tastes and pursuits were of the most refined character, and he delighted
in the society of all who were remarkable for ability in any walk of life, and
from whom he could derive information of any description. In political opinions
he was the very type and model of a Liberal Conservative, and the statesman to
whom he gave all his allegiance, together with a boundless admiration, was the
Duke of Wellington. But he was always much more of a patriot than a political
partisan, and he was oftener to be found giving an independent support to
different Governments than fighting in the ranks of Opposition. He will, I have
no doubt, be regarded as a loss to the country, even a greater loss than if he
had been more actively and conspicuously engaged in politics, for he stood
nearly alone in the station he occupied, with vast wealth, unblemished
character, esteemed by people of all parties, without an enemy in the world, and
having no personal objects to pursue; and though never thrusting himself
forward, alike fitted for either active or contemplative life, he was at all
times ready to exert his best energies in the public service or to promote the
benefit and happiness of his fellow creatures. He was sincerely religious,
without intolerance and austerity, or the slightest particle of ostentatious or
spiritual pride. It was not, however, in the annals of political history or in
the modest and unambitious incidents of his public career that his best
panegyric is to be found, but in the more placid walk of private life, in the
strict and conscientious discharge of his domestic and social duties, which was
at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> time congenial to his sense of moral obligation, and to the
benevolent impulses of his heart.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARACTER OF LORD ELLESMERE.</div>

<p>Lord Francis Leveson Gower, upon the death of his father the late Duke of
Sutherland, succeeded to the immense fortune entailed upon him by his
great-uncle, the Duke of Bridgewater, in the shape of the Bridgewater Canal, and
found himself the possessor of vast wealth, and surrounded by a population sunk
in ignorance and vice. From the first moment of his succession he considered
himself in the light of a trustee for working out the moral and spiritual
improvement of the people who were in a great measure committed to his charge.
He accepted the obligation in a spirit of cheerfulness and resolution, and the
due discharge of it continued to be the principal object of his interest and
care for the remainder of his life. He employed his wealth liberally in
promoting the material comfort and raising the moral condition of those by whose
labour that wealth was produced. Churches, schools, and reading-rooms rose
around Worsley Hall. His benevolent efforts were crowned with success, and he
reaped his reward in the blessings of the surrounding multitudes and in the
contemplation of their enjoyment of all the good which his active bounty had
bestowed upon them. Such qualities as were here displayed, and a life thus
devoted to works of duty and beneficence, made Lord Ellesmere an object of
general veneration and attachment; but those alone who belonged to his family,
or who had familiar access to the sanctuary of his domestic life, could
appreciate fully the excellence and the charm of his character, and comprehend
the immensity of the loss which those who were nearest and dearest to him have
sustained by his death. He regarded with indifference the ordinary objects of
worldly ambition; he lived in and for his family, and he was their joy, their
delight, and their pride, fulfilling in the most exemplary manner all the duties
of his station, political, social, literary, and artistic; unsurpassed as a
husband, father, brother, or friend. He cultivated unremittingly the society of
the best and wisest of his fellow-creatures, and it may be as truly said of him
as it was of certain sages of antiquity, that 'his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> excellent understanding was
adorned by study, ... and his days were spent in the pursuit of truth and the
practice of virtue.' The length of these precious days was not permitted by the
Divine Will to be extended to the ordinary duration of human life. In the three
last months, while death was gradually but surely, and with his full
consciousness, advancing, his courage was never shaken and the serenity of his
temper was never disturbed; he always seemed to have more consideration for
others than himself, and he met his approaching end with the firmness of a
philosopher and the resignation of a Christian. To witness such an end free from
bodily pain, with the mental faculties remaining unclouded till the last, full
of peace and charity and love, was the best consolation that was possible to the
family which surrounded his deathbed; to them he has left a memory which will be
long reverenced by all who honour virtue and patriotism, and which they will
cherish with never-ending sentiments of duty and affection. He has left them an
example how to live and how to die, and the world in which he had no enemy will
ungrudgingly acknowledge</p>

<p><i>February 27th.</i>&mdash;The political war is raging furiously, and personal
animosities are becoming bitterer than ever. Confusion, disorder, and doubt rage
in both the great camps. Derby made a grand onslaught in the beginning of last
week on the China question, and there was (an unusual thing in the Lords) an
adjourned debate. Granville was very apprehensive of being beaten, but
Bessborough, his able whipper-in, made such exertions that they ended by getting
a very good majority. All the speaking was on the side of the Opposition, but it
is quite curious how afraid people are of seriously shaking the Government. The
day the debate in the Lords ended, that in the Commons began on the same
question, <i>duce</i> Cobden.<a name="FNanchor_1_11" id="FNanchor_1_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_11" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The great event of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> first night was John
Russell's speech and powerful attack on the Government. It was one of his very
best efforts and extremely successful with the House, but it was exceedingly
bitter and displayed without stint or reason his hostile <i>animus</i>. It did all
the mischief he wished to do, and everybody admits that if a division had then
taken place Government would have been beaten by a great majority; but they have
since adjourned twice, and the debate stands over till Monday, and the aspect of
affairs appears to be very much altered. Whether it be that the effect of Lord
John's speech has evaporated, that a rally has taken place among the Liberals,
or that the aversion of the stiff Tories to the union between Gladstone and
their leaders, the approaching consummation of which seems not to be denied, the
general opinion has veered round, and now it is expected that Government will
have a majority. Here again, as in the Lords, the speaking was all with the
Opposition. Palmerston's speech is looked for with interest and curiosity. The
remarkable incidents connected with these transactions have been the
parliamentary conduct of Gladstone and John Russell and their respective
positions. Gladstone seems to have been so inflamed by spite and ill humour that
all prudence and discretion forsook him; he appears ready to say and do anything
and to act with everybody if he can only contribute to upset the Government,
though it is not easy to discover the cause of his bitterness, or what scheme of
future conduct he has devised for himself. Lord John came over in a state of
ill-humour which at first he appears to have kept under to a certain degree, and
to have wished to have the appearance of acting with perfect independence, but
still fairly and impartially speaking out what he thought the truth without
caring whom he offended or whom he pleased by so doing. Thus he shocked
Clarendon by what he said on the affair of Naples, and then pleased him very
much by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> his next speech on foreign affairs. Then on the Budget he came to the
aid of Lewis with great effect and bowled over Gladstone and Disraeli, yet even
then evincing a certain spirit of hostility about the tea duties; but on the
China question he gave way to all the bitter feeling that is in him, and cast
all moderation to the winds. It is impossible to conjecture what he promises to
himself, and what purpose he has in view by this conduct, for it is quite
extraordinary to what absolute nothingness his political power has fallen. Here
is a man who has been leader with occasional intervals of Whig Governments and
of the Whig party since 1834, and with great and admitted abilities, and yet he
is so entirely without following in the House of Commons that three
insignificant votes are the most he can command. His speech the other night was
very well received because it was a very good one, and because he spoke the
opinions of the greater number of his hearers.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_11" id="Footnote_1_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_11"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [A motion was made by Mr. Cobden condemning the violent measures
resorted to by the British authorities in the Canton river in consequence of the
seizure of the lorcha 'Arrow' by the Chinese when she had hoisted the British
flag. The debate was carried on with great acrimony, and ended by the adoption
of Mr. Cobden's motion by 263 to 247, a majority of 16 against the Government.]</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">DISPUTE WITH CHINA.</div>

<p>There is, in fact, a strong feeling, both in Parliament and the country, against
all that has been done at Canton, and this is the more remarkable because the
press has, upon the whole, taken the opposite side. I never could understand why
Palmerston and Clarendon were in such a hurry to identify themselves with
Bowring's proceedings, and to send out without delay a full approbation of all
he had done, till Granville told me that both of them had been under the
extraordinary delusion that the Canton affair had been very well done and would
be received with great applause and satisfaction here; in point of fact, that it
was a great <i>hit</i>, from which the Government would derive considerable
advantage, he (Granville) himself showing his good sense by taking exactly the
opposite view. He tells me that George Lewis does so likewise, and I dare say,
if the truth were known, that the majority of the Cabinet coincide with them. It
is remarkable that the defence of the Government in the Lords should have fallen
on a man who was speaking all the time against his own opinion, and I should
think Labouchere, who took up the defence in the House of Commons, was the most
unlikely man in the world to approve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> of such proceedings. Political necessities
which compel men to act thus insincerely, and to strive to make the worse appear
the better cause, with the full consciousness that they are fighting against
truth, appear to me frightfully demoralising, a sad sealing of the political
conscience, the spectacle of which is enough to scare honourable minds from
entering into an arena where the contest is to be carried on in such a manner.</p>

<p>If the Government should be beaten on the pending question, they will dissolve,
at least if the state of their financial affairs will allow them; but at all
events they will not resign without an appeal to the country, and this appeal
they will make not on this or that question, but on the great one of all,
whether the country desires that Palmerston should continue to be its minister,
and on this it is impossible to doubt what will be the reply. His popularity is
a fact beyond all doubt or cavil, and it is the more decisive, because not only
is there no rival popularity, but every one of the other public men who have
been, are, or might be his rivals are absolutely unpopular. Nobody cares any
longer for John Russell; everybody detests Gladstone; Disraeli has no influence
in the country, and a very doubtful position with his own party. He and Derby
have made up their minds to coalesce with Gladstone on the first good
opportunity, but it seems not unlikely that they will make such a split among
their own followers by so doing as to lose more than they will gain by the
junction. Palmerston's popularity does not extend to his colleagues, for not one
of whom does anybody care a straw. It is purely personal, and I do not think he
would strengthen himself by any other alliance he could form. This fact of his
popularity just at the end of his strange and chequered career is most
remarkable and not a little unaccountable; but innumerable circumstances prove
this to be the undoubted truth, and that it is manifested more decidedly out of
the House than in it, for in the House of Commons it does not amount to a
certainty of his having always a majority. It is curious that a session which
not long ago looked like being a very quiet one, in which there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> would be ample
leisure for consideration of legal and other practical reforms, should in the
first weeks be a scene of tremendous conflict, in which the very existence of
the Government is trembling in the balance.</p>


<p><i>March 2nd.</i>&mdash;Derby has announced to his assembled party that he is ready to
join with Gladstone, though he has not done so yet, and that as they are a
minority in the House of Commons, they ought to form any junction that would
make them strong enough to oust the present Government and form a Conservative
one. He finds it, however, a difficult matter to reconcile them all to any
alliance with the detested Gladstone. Great exertions have been made to secure a
majority to the Government, and John Russell's friends (the Duke of Bedford
especially) are bestirring themselves to take away some of the odium that
attaches to Lord John by securing his two or three followers for the division.</p>


<p><i>March 3rd.</i>&mdash;Nothing can equal the excitement and curiosity here about the
division. All sorts of efforts have been made all ways to influence votes.
George Byng and others who meant to vote with John Russell have been obliged to
promise to vote with the Government. Palmerston has had a meeting and harangued
them cheerily, but in spite of everything Hayter does not think he will have a
majority, but everybody expects it to be so near that there are as many opinions
as men. Much is expected to depend on Palmerston's speech, and unluckily for him
he is ill with both gout and cold. If they are beaten they will dissolve as
speedily as possible.</p>


<div class="sidenote">DEFEAT OF THE GOVERNMENT.</div>

<p><i>March 4th.</i>&mdash;A majority of 16 against Government, more than any of them
expected. A magnificent speech of Gladstone; Palmerston's speech is said to have
been very dull in the first part, and very bow-wow in the second; not very
judicious, on the whole bad, and it certainly failed to decide any doubtful
votes in his favour. I rejoice that the House of Commons has condemned this
iniquitous case for the honour of the country. I do not believe it will make any
difference as to the Government. When Palmerston appeals to the country it will
not be on the merits of the Canton case,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> but on his own political existence,
whether they will have him for minister or no. It is not, however, yet by any
means clear what the real opinion of the country is upon the question itself,
and whether they will be for the right or for the expedient, or that which the
Government thinks to be the expedient.</p>


<div class="sidenote">DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT.</div>

<p><i>Hatchford, March 10th.</i>&mdash;The intention of Government to dissolve Parliament was
announced on Friday last, and as far as one can judge at present, Palmerston
seems likely to have it all his own way. The press generally espouses his cause,
and the 'Times' particularly takes up the cudgels for him vehemently, and cries
out 'Coalition,' and abuses the majority and all who voted in it. At present,
public opinion seems to be running in his favour, and there is every appearance
of his having a triumphant election. But the cry of 'coalition and faction' is
perfectly absurd, and nothing more than the mere jargon which all parties employ
as their battle cry. There has been no coalition whatever, and that those who
clamour against it very well know. The only coalition of which there has been
any question has been one between Gladstone (with or without the other Peelites)
and Disraeli and Derby, but that has hitherto been <i>in posse</i> rather than <i>in
esse</i>, and it would have been much more plausible to raise the cry on the Budget
than on the Canton question. Nobody can read the list of the division without
seeing that the majority comprised the names of people who have never dreamt of
any coalition with anybody, and who voted entirely with reference to the merits
of the particular case, and though some (including Disraeli and Gladstone)
wished to damage the Government, many others were either friendly to them
generally, or at least neutral. To say that the majority was made up of a
factious coalition of men who sought to turn the Government out and to take
their places, is a wilful and deliberate lie, but it suits the Government to
raise the cry, and they find plenty of people to re-echo and to believe it. As
to the question itself, I am sure that some of the Cabinet, and probably more
than I know of, were in their hearts and consciences as much against the
question as any of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> opponents. Palmerston's popularity, and the manner in
which, he is encouraged and supported by the country, and the sympathy he finds
are really most extraordinary. It provokes me, because I think his great success
unmerited, but I have no wish to see him defeated at the election, because I see
no prospect of any better Government being formed. The pretension of the
Government and of their noisy supporters to find fault with the House of Commons
for expressing its independent opinion upon the conduct of the officials in
China is most preposterous and arrogant. Everybody admits that the Government
was not morally responsible for what was done, but because they chose, without
any necessity, to approve those acts and to accept the political responsibility
of them, it is pretended that the House of Commons ought not to have taken the
liberty to express any adverse opinion on the matter, and that it was factious
to do so. The scrape, if it was one, the Government got themselves into by their
precipitate approval of Bowring, and there was nothing in the resolution and the
vote which ought to have been considered as implying any general want of
confidence on the part of the House of Commons, more particularly when the
Government had just before carried their Budget by large majorities, and had not
met with any difficulty or rebuff on any point. If, indeed, matters are come to
such a pass, and such divinity hedges in the Palmerston Government that the
House of Commons is to be precluded from censuring any transaction, wherever and
by whomsoever done, which the Government thinks fit to sanction and approve of,
and if the fact of many men of very different opinions and opposite parties
concurring in such a vote is to expose the majority by which the vote is carried
to a charge of faction, coalition, and all sorts of base motives, then indeed,
instead of asking the Duke of Wellington's celebrated question, 'How is the
King's Government to be carried on?' it will be time to ask whether the Queen's
Government is to be considered despotic and infallible, and the functions of the
House of Commons reduced to the very humble ones of registering their acts and
re-echoing their approbation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>It seems to be entirely forgotten that in times when the Royal and ministerial
authority were much stronger than they are supposed to be now, and before the
Reform Bill had effected a sort of revolution in favour of the democratic
principle, all governments, however powerful or popular, sustained occasional
defeats and were obliged to submit to them, it being of course perfectly
understood that defeats which conveyed want of confidence and the withdrawal of
the general support of the House of Commons were to be deemed fatal and
conclusive. Every case of this kind must be determined according to the especial
circumstances of it, but it is a mere pretence to treat the Canton question as
one of this description, and the truth is that it is a dodge on their part, and
a pretext for going to the country and obtaining a majority, as they think they
have an opportunity of doing, on false pretences and by means of a vast deal of
humbug. The worst is, that after the immediate purpose has been answered, there
is certain to be some dangerous reaction, and as the cry of 'Palmerston' will be
the only one got up for the occasion, and everybody will be acceptable who will
declare for him, whatever crotchets or cries he may join to his partisanship, we
shall probably have a House of Commons full of all sorts of mischievous people
stirring every variety of mischievous question.</p>


<p><i>March 14th.</i>&mdash;I returned yesterday from Hatchford and find the current still
running strong, but some think a reaction in favour of John Russell has already
begun. He stands for the City and is in very good spirits, though his chances of
success do not look bright; but he is a gallant little fellow, likes to face
danger, and comes out well in times of difficulty.</p>


<p><i>March 24th.</i>&mdash;The dissolution took place on Saturday, and all the world is busy
about the elections; many places are without candidates, or with very bad ones,
and unable to find good ones. The dinner at the Mansion House the other day to
the Ministers was a sort of triumph to Palmerston, who was rapturously received
and cheered. He made a very bad speech, but which did very well for such an
audience. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> full of claptraps and reiterations of the exploded charges of
coalitions, &amp;c., which he is not ashamed to harp upon, and in his address to
Tiverton he talks of the 'combination only formed last session' to turn him out.
I find myself, <i>malgrï¿½ moi</i>, thrown back into my old state of antagonism towards
Palmerston, and what is very paradoxical, I am so without any hostility to his
Government or any desire for its being overthrown, for I cannot descry any
chance of a better, or, indeed, any possibility of forming another able to carry
on affairs at all; but I am inexpressibly disgusted at the egregious folly of
the country at his being made such an idol in this ridiculous way, and at the
false and hypocritical pretences upon which this dissolution has been founded,
and the enormous and shameful lying with which the country is deluged. I long to
write, print, and publish the truth, and to expose this miserable delusion; but
I repress the desire, because I cannot do so without exciting bitter personal
animosities, probably quarrels, and I can see no reasonable hope of producing
any effects which would sufficiently repay me for such consequences.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LIDDELL <i>v.</i> WESTERTON CASE.</div>

<p>The day before yesterday Pemberton Leigh gave judgement in the Privy Council in
the case of Liddell and Westerton; the Judicial Committee reversed in great
measure the judgements in the Courts below of Dr. Lushington and Sir John
Dodson, but not entirely. It was a very able judgement, and prepared with great
care and research, and so moderately and fairly framed that it was accepted
unanimously by the Committee, and even by the Bishops of Canterbury and London,
both Low Churchmen. It was drawn up by Pemberton Leigh himself, and its
publication will give the world in general some idea of his great ability, with
the extent of which few are acquainted. It is a very singular thing that in such
times as these, and when there is such a dearth of able men and so great a
demand for them, that he should voluntarily condemn himself to a state of
comparative obscurity, and refuse to take the station in public life which it
would be difficult to find any other man so well qualified to fill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>


<p><i>March 28th.</i>&mdash;At Althorp the last two days. Palmerston's address to Tiverton,
following his speech, at the Mansion House, has excited great indignation in all
who are not thorough Palmerstonians. Both were full of deception and falsehood.
John Russell is particularly incensed, and said these two productions were
unworthy of a gentleman, and so they were. Malmesbury has addressed to
Palmerston a letter in the newspapers on the subject, which though not well
written is true, and fully justified by what Palmerston said; but all this
signifies very little, the current is too strong to be opposed, and it is
provoking to see the Conservatives endeavouring to bolster up their pretensions
by saying they would have supported Palmerston on the China question, if they
had been in Parliament, or promising to support him if they are elected.
Yesterday, which was the first day of returns, does not give much difference;
to-day is the polling for the City, and nobody has an idea how the election will
go, whether Lord John will come in, and if he does which of the four will go to
the wall. He was enthusiastically received yesterday, and the show of hands was
unanimous in his favour, but this proves very little, and his organisation is
miserably defective; had it been better and begun earlier, it is probable that
his success would have been certain; he is the favourite as it is. Palmerston's
speech at Tiverton yesterday was less objectionable than his address and speech
at the Mansion House, and he left himself entirely unfettered on the subject of
Reform, and rightly. The Parliament promises to be a Radical one, and I fully
expect that the result of all this great commotion will be to give a stimulus to
organize Reform; nor will it surprise me if Palmerston should find it conducive
to his interest as minister to appear in the character of a Reformer, if he were
to fling overboard all his old opinions, and to pay this price for a renewed
lease of his own power. Wilkes used to say he had never been a <i>Wilkite</i>, but
Palmerston has never been anything but a Palmerstonian, and I firmly believe
that at seventy-three years of age his single thought is how to secure for
himself power for his life, and that he will not scruple to accept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> measures
which, so far as he thinks about it, he believes to be constitutionally
dangerous and mischievous if by so doing he can maintain himself on the Treasury
Bench.</p>


<div class="sidenote">RESULTS OF THE ELECTION.</div>

<p><i>March 29th.</i>&mdash;Great excitement yesterday in the town, particularly at Brooks's.
The most interesting event was the City election, and the return, which under
the circumstances may be called triumphant, of John Russell, which was made more
agreeable to himself and his friends by the defeat of Raikes Currie, who came
from Northampton on purpose to turn him out. Up to the last hour John Russell
continued to lead at the head of the poll, after which he fell off and only
ended third, but still he had 7,000 votes after having been assured by his old
adherents (J. Abel Smith in particular) that his success was hopeless, that he
would be beaten 'disgracefully,' and probably would have hardly any votes at
all.</p>

<p>After this the most interesting events were the defeats of the Manchester men,
and generally, though not universally, of the voters for Cobden's motion, Bright
and Milner Gibson, Cobden, Ricardo, Layard, all defeated. It seems that
Manchester and the other great towns had got tired of their leaders, who had
made themselves unpopular by their opposition to the war. I am sorry for the
loss of Bright and Cobden, because such able men ought not to be ousted and
replaced by mediocrities.</p>

<p>Palmerston's speech at Tiverton was in the same style, but far less offensive
and objectionable than his address and his Mansion House harangue. The most
remarkable part of it was the total silence which he observed as to his
intention upon reforms and domestic questions generally, or rather his positive
refusal to say a word on the subject or to pledge himself in any way; he
evidently means to meet his Parliament free to take any course his interests may
dictate. There was one remarkable speech yesterday, considering what the man is
who uttered it. Vernon Smith at Northampton spoke as follows: 'Mr. Disraeli said
Lord Palmerston was the Tory chief of a Radical Cabinet. I do not admit the
description as regards Lord Palmerston, but I accept the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> designation as to the
Cabinet of which I am a member. A great statesman once said that parties were
like fishes (it was snakes, I believe), and their heads were propelled by their
tails, and it will very likely be found that the head of the Government will in
like manner be propelled by his tail.' The words are not exact, but the meaning
is, and it must be owned a remarkable declaration for a Cabinet Minister to make
as to his chief, and such a chief. I believe that it will turn out to be the
truth. The returns so far as they have gone are frightful, and a deluge of
Radicalism and violence will burst out in the House of Commons. There will be a
Radical majority prepared to support Lord Palmerston and to keep him in power,
but on the condition of his doing their bidding, and consenting to their
demands, nor will he be able to help himself. He will no doubt try to do as
little as possible, but there will be no strong Conservative party to which he
can appeal from and against his own Radical supporters; the Conservatives will
be too weak to help him, and probably will not be inclined to help him out of
his difficulty if they could. At his age his only object will be to grasp power
while he lives. <i>Aprï¿½s moi le dï¿½luge</i> will be his motto, and my expectation is
that he will never consent to sacrifice power from scruples or upon principles,
and will consent to anything that may be necessary rather than allow himself to
be outbid and to see power torn from his hands. The prospect seems to me
tremendous. The cry of Palmerston, and nothing but Palmerston, has done very
well to go to the hustings on, but having accomplished its purpose, other cries
much more serious will soon take its place, and we shall see, as the Prince
said, Constitutional Government on its trial with a vengeance.</p>


<p><i>March 31st.</i>&mdash;The elections continue to be unfavourable to the Conservatives,
but the people at Brooks's, and the Government generally, are too sanguine when
they call everything gain to them where a Conservative is replaced by a Liberal,
for in many cases the so-called Liberal is a violent Radical, very likely to
give much more trouble to the Government than the Conservative who was turned
out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> The gains to Government up to this time (and the borough elections are all
over) are calculated at 20, making a difference of 40 votes; but the
Conservatives do not admit this, and will make other calculations with different
results.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TRIUMPH OF LORD PALMERSTON.</div>

<p>There is no denying the fact, however, that a strong sense has been evinced of
partiality for Palmerston and resentment against the China vote. The news of the
Emperor of China having ordered Yeo to make peace on any terms comes very
opportunely, but nothing can be so absurd as the pretence that by so doing the
Emperor himself condemns his Viceroy and justifies our conduct at Canton. It
only proves that His Majesty is very much alarmed, and wishes to heal the breach
as quickly as possible, and on any terms he can. I am bound to say that many
people, not extravagant either, maintain that this promises to be a very good
Parliament, and by no means so dangerous as my fears have pictured it to myself;
still I cannot look upon it as a safe and innocent Parliament. Cardwell's defeat
at Oxford proves how low the Peelites are. Frederic Peel's loss of his seat is a
great inconvenience to the Government, and one does not see how it is to be
repaired, for it is almost impossible in these days to treat any place (if one
can be found) as a nomination borough, turn the sitting member out, and put him
in instead. The serious part of it is that he has to move the Army Estimates,
and nobody else can do it now.</p>

<p>Old Lady Keith is dead, at some prodigious age. She was the 'Queeny' of Dr.
Johnson, Mrs. Hale's daughter, and was the last surviving link between those
times and our own, and probably the only person surviving who could remember
Johnson himself and his remarkable contemporaries, or who had lived in intimacy
with them.</p>

<p><i>April 4th, 1857.</i>&mdash;The elections are drawing to a close. It is strange that
what ought to be a matter of fact is made matter of opinion, for while the Whigs
of Brooks's and the Liberals generally claim an immense gain, the Conservatives
and the Carlton Club and their organs only admit an inconsiderable loss. There
can be no doubt, however, that a great many Conservatives have lost their seats,
and a great many Radicals and Palmerstonians have been elected. At Brooks's they
insist that it will be a very good Parliament, and they are throwing their caps
up at the Government successes; but it seems to me that they are reckoning
somewhat rashly, and counting as gains to the Government many men who will be
found more troublesome and unmanageable than the moderate men over whose defeats
they are exulting. But as to gains and losses, and all calculations, I agree
with the late Speaker, Lord Eversley, who said to me the other day that nothing
could be so fallacious as all such calcu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>lations, and that it is impossible to
know the result till Parliament meets, and it is seen how the new members group
themselves. The most striking and remarkable feature of this election is the
complete rout of the Peelites and of the Manchester men, the Old Leaguers. For a
long time past it has been absurd to talk of the Peelites as a Party. There were
not a dozen men in the House of Commons who could by any possibility be so
designated, and in fact only a few formerly members of Sir Robert Peel's
Government or of Lord Aberdeen's, who still kept together, and were called
Peelites, because they would not be either Whigs or Tories or Radicals. Now the
designation must fall to the ground. Half these men have lost their seats; of
the rest, some repudiate the association and announce their independence; some
join, or are ready to join, Derby and the Tories; others openly declare their
adhesion to Palmerston; and thus in one way or another there are no <i>Peelites</i>
left.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEFEAT OF COBDEN AND BRIGHT.</div>

<p>The fate of Bright, Cobden, and Co. exhibits a curious example of the fleeting
and worthless nature of popular favour. They who were once the idols of
millions, and not without cause, have not only lost all their popularity, but
are objects of execration, and can nowhere find a parliamentary resting place.
No constituency will hear of them. The great towns of Lancashire prefer any
mediocrities to Bright and Cobden. It seems that they had already ceased to be
popular, when they made themselves enormously unpopular, and excited great
resentment, by their opposition to the Russian War, the rage for which was not
less intense in Manchester and all the manufacturing district than in the rest
of the kingdom. This great crime, as it appeared in the eyes of their
constituents, was never pardoned, and their punishment was probably determined
while the war was still going on. As the favour of Cobden fell, so that of
Palmerston rose, and his visit to Manchester a few months ago raised the favour
to a pitch of enthusiasm. When Cobden therefore originated the China motion, he
no doubt gave great offence, and he sealed his own condemnation. Bright has been
long abroad, and has done nothing lately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> that any one could take umbrage at,
but his opposition to the war has not been forgotten or forgiven, and when
Cobden appeared at Manchester as his representative, and made a very able speech
in his behalf, it is highly probable that his advocacy was in itself fatal to
his re-election. It seems quite clear that another man, Sir Elkanah Armytage,
lost his election at Salford solely because he was strongly supported and
recommended by Cobden.</p>


<p><i>May 1st.</i>&mdash;Parliament met yesterday, the last (Irish) election having ended
only a few days before. Denison's election as Speaker went off very quietly. The
prevailing opinion now seems to be that this will prove a good Parliament, on
the whole safe and moderate, and an improvement on the last. All the news we get
from China, or in reference to Chinese affairs, only proves the more strongly
how foolish and mischievous the conduct of Bowring was, and what a sound and
correct judgement the vote of the House of Commons expressed upon it. It is
impossible to conjecture what the result of the war now began will be, but is
quite certain that we shall have to wade to our ends through all sorts of
horrors and atrocities, which it does not become us to inflict, though the
Chinese are a savage, stupid, and uninteresting people, who in some degree
deserve the sufferings that will be inflicted on them, though perhaps not at our
hands.</p>

<p>George Anson<a name="FNanchor_1_12" id="FNanchor_1_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_12" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> writes to me from India that there is a strange feeling of
discontent pervading the Indian Army from religious causes, and a suspicion that
we are going to employ our irresistible power in forcing Christianity upon them.
It is not true, but the natives will never be quite convinced that it is not, as
long as Exeter Hall and the missionaries are permitted to have <i>carte blanche</i>
and work their will as they please in those regions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF LADY ASHBURTON.</div>

<p><i>May 10th.</i>&mdash;I passed the last week at Wynnstay for Chester races; a very fine
place. The events that have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> occurred in the course of the last ten days are the
opening of the Manchester Exhibition, very successfully; the first proceedings
of the new Parliament, which promise a quiet session and a peaceful reign to
Palmerston, who has put the House in good humour by promising a Reform Bill next
year; the death of the Duchess of Gloster, and, what interests the world still
more, the death of Lady Ashburton.<a name="FNanchor_1_13" id="FNanchor_1_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_13" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Milnes has written a short, but very fair
and appropriate notice of her for the 'Times' newspaper, which of course was
intended as a eulogy, and not as a <i>character</i>, with the bad as well as the good
that could be said of her. Lady Ashburton was perhaps, on the whole, the most
conspicuous woman in the society of the present day. She was undoubtedly very
intelligent, with much quickness and vivacity in conversation, and by dint of a
good deal of desultory reading and social intercourse with men more or less
distinguished, she had improved her mind, and made herself a very agreeable
woman, and had acquired no small reputation for ability and wit. It is never
difficult for a woman in a great position and with some talent for conversation
to attract a large society around her, and to have a number of admirers and
devoted <i>habituï¿½s</i>. Lady Ashburton laid herself out for this, and while she
exercised hospitality on a great scale, she was more of a <i>prï¿½cieuse</i> than any
woman I have known. She was, or affected to be, extremely intimate with many men
whose literary celebrity or talents constituted their only attraction, and while
they were gratified by the attentions of the great lady, her vanity was
flattered by the homage of such men, of whom Carlyle was the principal. It is
only justice to her to say that she treated her literary friends with constant
kindness and the most unselfish attentions. They, their wives and children (when
they had any),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> were received at her house in the country, and entertained there
for weeks without any airs of patronage, and with a spirit of genuine
benevolence as well as hospitality. She was in her youth tall and commanding in
person, but without any pretension to good looks; still she was not altogether
destitute of sentiment and coquetry, or incapable of both feeling and inspiring
a certain amount of passion. The only man with whom she was ever what could be
called <i>in love</i> was Clarendon, and that feeling was never entirely extinct, and
the recollection of it kept up a sort of undefined relation between them to the
end of her life. Two men were certainly in love with her, both distinguished in
different ways. One was John Mill, who was sentimentally attached to her, and
for a long time was devoted to her society. She was pleased and flattered by his
devotion, but as she did not in the slightest degree return his passion, though
she admired his abilities, he at last came to resent her indifference, and ended
by estranging himself from her entirely, and proved the strength of his feeling
by his obstinate refusal to continue even his acquaintance with her. Her other
admirer was Charles Buller, with whom she was extremely intimate, but without
ever reciprocating his love. Curiously enough, they were very like each other in
person, as well as in their mental accomplishments. They had both the same
spirits and cleverness in conversation, and the same quickness and drollery in
repartee. I remember Allen well describing them, when he said that their talk
was like that in the polite conversation between Never Out and Miss Notable. Her
faults appeared to be caprice and a disposition to quarrels and <i>tracasseries</i>
about nothing, which, however common amongst ordinary women, were unworthy of
her superior understanding. But during her last illness all that was bad and
hard in her nature seemed to be improved and softened, and she became full of
charity, good-will, and the milk of human kindness. Her brother and her
sister-in-law, who, forgetting former estrangements, hastened to her sickbed,
were received by her with overflowing tenderness, and all selfish and unamiable
feelings seemed to be entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> subdued within her. Had she recovered she would
probably have lived a better and a happier woman, and as it is she has died in
charity with all the world, and has left behind her corresponding sentiments of
affection and regret for her memory. I was once very intimate with her, but for
a long time past our intimacy had dwindled into ordinary acquaintance.</p>

<p><i>June 3rd.</i>&mdash;There is really nothing to write about, but it is evident that the
session is going to pass away in the most quiet and uneventful manner. Never had
Minister such a peaceful and undisturbed reign as Palmerston's. There is
something almost alarming in his prodigious felicity and success. Everything
prospers with him. In the House of Commons there is scarcely a semblance of
opposition to anything he proposes; a speech or two here and there from Roebuck,
or some stray Radical, against some part of the Princess Royal's dowry, but
hardly any attempt at divisions; and when there have been any, the minorities
have been so ridiculously small as to show the hopelessness of opposition. The
only men who might be formidable or troublesome seem to have adopted the prudent
course of not kicking against the pricks. John Russell evinces no hostility, and
accepts Hayter's letters. Gladstone hardly ever goes near the House of Commons,
and never opens his lips. There seems to be a disposition in both Houses to work
and bring legislative reforms to a conclusion. The House of Lords has been very
busy with the Divorce Bill, and there has been a good deal of vigorous debating,
particularly among Lyndhurst, the Bishops of Oxford and London, and Campbell and
Wensleydale, who hate each other, and have interchanged blows.</p>


<div class="sidenote">THE HANDEL CONCERTS.</div>

<p><i>June 20th.</i>&mdash;All this past week the world has been occupied with the Handel
Concerts at the Crystal Palace, which went off with the greatest success and
<i>ï¿½clat</i>. I went to the first ('Messiah'), and the last ('Israel in Egypt'); they
were amazingly grand, and the beauty of the <i>locale</i>, with the vast crowds
assembled in it, made an imposing spectacle. The arrangements were perfect, and
nothing could be easier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> than the access and egress, or more comfortable than
the accommodation. But the wonderful assembly of 2,000 vocal and 500
instrumental performers did not produce musical effect so agreeable and so
perfect as the smaller number in the smaller space of Exeter Hall. The volume of
sound was dispersed and lost in the prodigious space, and fine as it undoubtedly
was, I much prefer the concerts of the Harmonic Society.</p>

<p>Fould<a name="FNanchor_1_14" id="FNanchor_1_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_14" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> came over from Paris the other day for the purpose of going to see the
Manchester Exhibition. He was received with great distinction. The Queen invited
him to Windsor for Ascot, and Granville gave him a breakfast here to meet the
financial notabilities whom he wanted to talk to. We had the Chancellor of the
Exchequer and an ex-Chancellor (C. Wood), the Governor of the Bank, and the
ex-Governor of the Bank, <i>cum multis aliis</i>. He said that their financial
affairs in France were in a very healthy state, which is contrary to the general
impression here.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE QUEEN AND LORD PALMERSTON.</div>

<p>I met Clarendon in the Park a day or two ago, and had some talk with him in the
friendly and intimate tone of former times, which rejoiced my heart, because it
proved that though circumstances and accidental habits had impeded our
intercourse, there exist still the same feelings of regard towards me in his
mind, and if our intercourse was restored again, he would probably fall into the
same habit of confidence and communication which formerly existed, but which has
lately been completely interrupted. He talked of Palmerston, his position and
his health, and his <i>rapports</i> with the Queen, who is now entirely reconciled to
him. She treats him with unreserved confidence, and he treats her with a
deference and attention which have produced a very favourable change in her
sentiments towards him. Clarendon told me that Palmerston had lately been ailing
in a way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> to cause some uneasiness. He had had a bad leg with a sore that it had
been found difficult to heal, but he appears to have got over it. This might
have been very serious. Clarendon talked one day to the Queen about Palmerston's
health, concerning which she expressed her anxiety, when Clarendon said she
might indeed be anxious, for it was of the greatest importance to her, and if
anything happened to him he did not know where she could look for a successor to
him, that she had often expressed her great desire to have a <i>strong</i> Government,
and that she had now got one, Palmerston being a really strong Minister. She
admitted the truth of it. Clarendon said he was always very earnest with her to
bestow her whole confidence on Palmerston, and not even to talk to others on any
subjects which properly belonged to him, and he had more than once (when,
according to her custom, she began to talk to him on certain things) said to
her,'Madam, that concerns Lord Palmerston, and I think your Majesty had better
reserve it for your communications with him.' He referred to the wonderful
change in his own relations with Palmerston, that seven or eight years ago
Palmerston was full of hatred and suspicion of him, and now they were the best
of friends, with mutual confidence and good will, and lately when he was talking
to Palmerston of the satisfactory state of his relations with the Queen and of
the utility it was to his Government that it should be so, Palmerston said, 'And
it is likewise a very good thing that she has such boundless confidence in her
Secretary for Foreign Affairs, when after all there is nothing she cares about
so much.'</p>


<p><i>June 28th.</i>&mdash;I went last Saturday week to Strawberry Hill.<a name="FNanchor_1_15" id="FNanchor_1_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_15" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> A large party of
people, the Persignys, the Speaker and Lady Charlotte, etc.; it is an enjoyable
villa, with its vast expanse of grass, profusion of flowers, and fine trees
affording ample shade. Horace Walpole's ridiculous house is un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>altered, but
furbished up and made comfortable. I regret to hear that Denison does not make a
very good Speaker, and that the Government think they made a mistake in putting
him into the Chair. It was Palmerston's doing, who would hear of nobody else.
There are several men among the Opposition who would probably have been fitter,
but with the great majority the Government have they were in a manner compelled
to take a man from their own party. Denison says it is owing to the laxity of
Palmerston himself if things do not go on so well as they might in the House of
Commons.</p>

<p>At Hatchford the past week, and when I got to town I was apprised of the
disastrous news from India,<a name="FNanchor_2_16" id="FNanchor_2_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_16" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the most serious occurrence that has ever been in
that quarter, not only from the magnitude of the events themselves as the
telegraph conveys them, but because it is quite impossible to estimate the
gravity of the case, nor what the extent of it may be. Till we receive the
details it is idle to speculate upon it.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_15" id="Footnote_1_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_15"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [Strawberry Hill was the residence of the Countess of Waldegrave, to
whom it had passed on the death of her second husband, the Earl of Waldegrave.
It was then, and continued to be until her death in 1879, the most hospitable
villa in the neighbourhood, and the constant resort of all that was
distinguished in politics and in letters.]</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_2_16" id="Footnote_2_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_16"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> [The Indian mutiny broke out at Meerut on Sunday, 10th May, but the
details were not known in England till nearly six weeks later. General Anson
died at Kurnaul on the 27th May.]</p></div>

<p>The Queen has made Prince Albert 'Prince Consort' by a patent ordered in
Council, but as this act confers on him neither title, dignity, nor privileges,
I cannot see the use of it. He was already as high in England as he can be,
assuming the Crown Matrimonial to be out of the question, and it will give him
no higher rank abroad, where our acts have no validity.</p>


<div class="sidenote">THE MUTINY IN INDIA.</div>

<p><i>July 15th.</i>&mdash;For the last three weeks or more all public interest and curiosity
have been absorbed in the affairs of India and the great Mutiny that has broken
out there, and which has now assumed such an alarming character. I had intended
to take some notice of this, and of other matters which time and the hour have
brought forth; but, according to my bad custom, I kept putting it off, till at
last all other things were driven out of my mind by the news which so
unexpectedly reached us on Saturday last of the death of George Anson from a
sudden attack of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> cholera. He was the oldest and most intimate friend I had, and
almost the last surviving associate of my youth. I reserve for another moment to
say a word or two of a man who, without great abilities or a great career, was
too conspicuous a member of society to be passed over without some notice.</p>

<p>The alarm created here by the Indian news is very great, and Ellenborough
(reckoned a great authority on Indian matters) does his best to increase it. The
serious part of it is that no one can tell or venture to predict what the extent
of the calamity may be, and what proportions the mischief may possibly assume.
It is certain that hitherto the Government and the East India Company have been
in what is called a fool's paradise on the subject. They have been so long
accustomed to consider our Empire there as established on so solid a foundation,
and so entirely out of the reach of danger, that they never have paid any
attention to those who hinted at possible perils, and I don't think anybody ever
foresaw anything like what has occurred, and they were disinclined to adopt any
of the precautionary recommendations which would have been attended with
expense, and the Press, and the public who are always led by the Press, took the
same easy view of the subject. While the Russian War was going on a clamour was
raised against Government for not calling away <i>all</i> the British troops in India
and sending them to the Crimea, and those who went mad about the Crimean War
would willingly have left India without a single European regiment, and have
entrusted all our interests to the fidelity and attachment of the Native army.
Though our Government was willing enough to enter into anything that the passion
of the multitude suggested, they were not so insane as all that; but as it is,
we may consider it most providential that the mutiny did not show itself during
the Russian, or indeed during the Persian war. If it had happened while we were
still fighting in the Crimea, we could not have sent out the force that would
have been indispensable to save India. At the present moment the interest of the
public is not greater than its apprehensions and alarm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> Rumours of every sort
are rife, generally of the most disastrous kind, and though the mails only come
at a fortnight's interval, and it is physically impossible that any intelligence
should reach us during those intervals, the public curiosity is fed and excited
by continual rumours, which generally circulate stories of fresh disasters and
dangers. There is a disposition in some quarters to make if possible poor Anson
the scapegoat, and, now that he is dead and cannot defend himself, to attribute
to him and to his misconduct or laches the misfortunes that have befallen us. I
know not what he may have written home to the civil and military authorities;
but, if I may judge by the tenor of his correspondence with me, I should infer
that he has warned the Government against leaving India without adequate
protection, and constantly urged the expediency of sending out fresh troops. I
have long expected that the day would come when we should find reason for
regretting our expansive policy and our going on with continual conquests and
annexations.</p>

<p>We are overrun with Royalties present and prospective. Besides our Princess
Royal's bridegroom, there are here the King of the Belgians' son and daughter,
Prince Napoleon, the Queen of the Netherlands, and the Montpensiers <i>as Spanish
Princes</i>, in which capacity Persigny has had to pay his court to them, and they
have had to receive the Ambassador of Louis Napoleon.</p>


<p><i>July 19th.</i>&mdash;Although it is impossible that any fresh accounts should have come
from India, reports are rife of fresh insurrections and of all sorts of evils.
Amidst all the bad news from India the good fortune is that so many of the
Native troops, and not only the military, but the whole population of the
Punjaub, have shown so much fidelity and attachment to the British Government.
It is the strongest testimony to the wisdom and justice of our rule, and of the
capacity of the natives to appreciate the benefits they derive from it, for
beyond all question the introduction of European civilisation into the East, and
the substitution of such a government as that of England for the cruel,
rapacious, and capricious dominion of Oriental chiefs and dynasties, is the
greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> boon that the people could have had conferred upon them. Our
administration may not have been faultless, and in some instances it may have
been oppressive, and it may have often offended against the habits and
prejudices of the natives, but it is certainly very superior in every respect,
and infinitely more beneficent than any rule, either of Hindoos or Mahometans,
that has ever been known in India. However, people much more civilized and more
sagacious than the Indians do not always know what is best for them, or most
likely to promote their happiness, so it will not be surprising if these
disorders should continue to increase, supposing the means of immediately and
effectually suppressing them should be found wanting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TEMPER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS</div>

<p>For the last week the House of Commons has presented a more animated appearance
than during the preceding months of this dull and passive session. Gladstone has
reappeared and proved that his oratorical powers have not been rusted by his
retirement, and John Russell has come forth showing his teeth, but not yet
attempting to bite the Government. Palmerston, evidently nettled by these two,
as well as by Roebuck and Disraeli, has spoken with considerable asperity, and
with an insolent air of superiority and defiance, which has hitherto not been
usual to him, and which has given no little offence. There are evident symptoms
of an approaching cessation of that humble and deferential submission to his
will which has hitherto distinguished his servile majority, and though it is not
clear in what way they will assert their independence, those who watch the
symptoms think that he will not find the same passive disposition in the next
session, and if anything should go seriously wrong there would be open and
general rebellion. Up to the present time, however, there is nothing to be seen
but a certain amount of restlessness and a disposition to find fault, and the
Government seem still to command the same enormous majorities, and Palmerston to
be as powerful as ever, if he is not quite so popular. A violent effort is made
by a number of Liberals in the House of Commons to renew the contest with the
House of Lords for the admission of the Jews (the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> newspapers contain all the
details of this attempt), which cannot be pursued without mischievous results,
and will fail in its object.</p>


<p><i>August 2nd.</i>&mdash;The Civil War in India, for such it may be called, supersedes
every other object of interest, and the successive mails are looked for with the
utmost impatience. The Government, though anxious and nervous, are not
disheartened, and as far as we can judge the authorities in India have not been
deficient in the emergency. Canning writes in good spirits, and all accounts
agree in reporting that he has done his work hitherto very well. The discussions
in Parliament have been on the whole creditable. Disraeli came down to the House
of Commons with a long set oration, in which he entered at great length into the
causes of the present confusion, and the misgovernment and bad policy which had
engendered it, and although his speech was able, and probably contained a great
deal that was true, it was deemed (as it was) mischievous and ill-timed, and
very ill received by the House. He was rebuked with some asperity by Tom Baring,
his own political adherent, and by Lord John Russell, who declared it to be the
duty of the House to give every support to the Government in such a crisis. In
the House of Lords Ellenborough was as mischievous and ill-disposed as Disraeli
in the Commons, and was no better received. Granville administered to him a
severe lecture, by no means ill done, and the House of Lords went with
Granville.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PRINCE CONSORT.</div>

<p>Last week was passed at Goodwood, with fine weather, and the usual fï¿½te with the
unusual accompaniment of foreign Royalties. First the Comte de Paris for a
night, and then the Queen of the Netherlands for two. The young French Prince is
good-humoured and unpretending, the Queen is very gay, natural, and pleasing. I
renewed an acquaintance I had made with her at Ems many years ago. It is a new
feature in the present day the flitting about of Royal personages. Besides these
I have named, the Prince Napoleon has been finishing a tour through England and
part of Ireland by a visit to Osborne, and the Emperor and Empress are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> coming
to Osborne for a week. Prince Albert has been to Brussels for the marriage of
the Princess Charlotte, where he seems to have made his first experiment of the
effect to be obtained from his newly-acquired title of 'Prince Consort of
England,' as I see that he signed the marriage contract immediately after the
Queen Marie Amï¿½lie, and before an Austrian Archduke who was present.</p>


<p><i>August 12th.</i>&mdash;I was at Stoke on Saturday and Sunday, and went over to see
Bulstrode; surprised to find the place less <i>dï¿½labrï¿½</i>, and more capable of being
restored than I expected. I passed the first fifteen years of my life there, and
don't know whether the place or myself is the most changed. To feed our
curiosity during the intervals between the Indian mails, the newspapers, the
'Times' especially, collect all the letters they can obtain, and publish them
day by day. We have had a success in China, but I always tremble for the
consequences of our successes there, lest we should be seduced or compelled into
making permanent settlements and further extensions of our Empire in the East.
Parliament is approaching its close, and the Government ends the session with
unimpaired strength, but depending entirely on Palmerston's life, for there is
nobody else capable of leading the House of Commons. There are growing symptoms
of independence on the part of the House in the shape of adverse votes every now
and then, principally on matters of estimates.</p>


<p><i>August 20 th.</i>&mdash;I have read over the few preceding pages, and am disgusted to
find how barren they are of interest and how little worth preserving. They show
how entirely my social relations have ceased with all those friends and
acquaintances from whom I have been in the habit of drawing the information
which the earlier parts of this journal contain, and consequently my total
ignorance of all political subjects. There was a time when I should have had a
great deal to say upon passing events of interest or importance, but all that is
gone by.</p>

<p>The visit of the Emperor Napoleon at Osborne seems to have been spent in
discussing the affairs of the Principalities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> and patching up the quarrels of
the Ambassadors at Constantinople. As far as outward appearances go we do not
appear to have played a very brilliant part, and the Opposition papers think
they have got a good case on which to twit Palmerston, but as I do not know what
has really taken place, I abstain from expressing any opinion upon the conduct
of our Government.</p>

<p>The session of Parliament has been prolonged beyond all expectation by the
vehement and acrimonious debates upon the Divorce Bill in the House of Commons,
which has been very ably and vigorously fought by Bethell on one side <i>cum
quibusdam aliis</i>, and Gladstone, Walpole, and Heathcote on the other. The
Opposition hoped by constant obstructions to wear out the patience of Palmerston
and to get the Bill put off till next session. Palmerston, however, was firmly
resolved not to submit to this, and when they found that he was so determined,
they contented themselves with insisting upon certain amendments, which
Palmerston thought it prudent to consent to, and the spirit of compromise and
concession which the Government have lately evinced has softened in some degree
the asperity of the debates, and at last enabled the Government to carry the
Bill. Bethell, who has fought the battle with great ability, is not a little
disgusted at the concessions to which he has been forced to consent, and has
done so with a solemn protest and warning with regard to the exemption clause
for the clergy, which the Government have very reluctantly consented to, but on
which Granville assures me they had no option, and that if they had refused to
give way they would have infallibly been beaten upon it. I dined at Richmond
with Lord Lansdowne yesterday, to meet the Duchess of Orleans and the Comte de
Paris. I had never seen her before. She is plain, but pleasing, and with very
good manners.</p>


<p><i>August 21st.</i>&mdash;The Divorce Bill having passed the House of Commons, went up
to the House of Lords yesterday, when Lord Redesdale attempted to strangle it by
a dodge, which he was obliged to give up in consequence of the vigorous attacks
made upon him by the Ministerial side, who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> supported even by St. Leonards,
and particularly by an indignant and effective speech, made by Lord Lansdowne,
who, in spite of weakness and gout, from which, he was actually suffering, spoke
with extraordinary spirit. If Redesdale had persisted, and gone to a division,
the Government would probably have been beaten, and the labour of half the
session would have been thrown away. As it is, there is to be a fight on Monday
next, the result of which depends on which side can get the greatest number to
come up from the country to vote.</p>


<div class="sidenote">CLOSE OF THE SESSION.</div>

<p><i>September 6th.</i>&mdash;Went to Worsley on Thursday last, in order to go from thence
to see the Manchester Exhibition, which is very pretty, but appears diminutive
after the London and Sydenham Exhibitions. Its principal attraction is in the
excellent collection of pictures; it will be a failure in a pecuniary point of
view, but there are plenty of rich people in Manchester able and willing to bear
the expenses. The session closed very quietly, though not without some
grumbling. Some complained that Parliament should not continue to sit while the
Indian troubles are going on with undiminished force, others that the Queen
should go to Scotland; but the Government have brought their labours to a close
very prosperously, and Palmerston continues as powerful and as secure as ever.
There is no longer the same enthusiasm there was for him, but there is a
universal impression that he is indispensable, and on the whole a feeling of
satisfaction and confidence in his administration. Even I myself am compelled in
candour to acknowledge that he does at least as well as anybody else would be
likely to do, and no complaints can justly be made against the Government of any
supineness in sending out adequate reinforcements to India. Lewis told me, just
as Parliament was prorogued, that they were thoroughly impressed with the
gravity of the case, and conscious of the danger, and that they were going to
send out every man they could muster here or in the Colonies, and they have
already despatched troops in great numbers with remarkable celerity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>They have made some Peers, of whom the most conspicuous is Macaulay, and I have
not seen or heard any complaints of his elevation. Lord Lansdowne has declined
the offered Dukedom, which I rather regret, for such a public recognition of his
character and services during a long life would have been graceful and becoming,
and the report of it elicited from all quarters expressions of satisfaction at
such an honour having been so worthily conferred.</p>

<p>While Macaulay is thus ascending to the House of Peers, his old enemy and rival
Croker has descended to the grave, very noiselessly and almost without
observation, for he had been for some time so withdrawn from the world that he
was nearly forgotten. He had lived to see all his predictions of ruin and
disaster to the country completely falsified. He continued till the last year or
two to exhale his bitterness and spite in the columns of the 'Quarterly Review,'
but at last the Editor (who had long been sick of his contributions) contrived
to get rid of him. I never lived in any intimacy with him, and seldom met him in
society, but he certainly occupied a high place among the second-rate men of his
time; he had very considerable talents, great industry, with much information
and a retentive memory. He spoke in Parliament with considerable force, and in
society his long acquaintance with the world and with public affairs, and his
stores of general knowledge made him entertaining, though he was too overbearing
to be agreeable. He was particularly disliked by Macaulay, who never lost an
opportunity of venting his antipathy by attacks upon him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HISTORY OF THE LIFE PEERAGES.</div>

<p><i>Holwood, September 10th.</i>&mdash;I came here on Tuesday on a visit to the
Chancellor.<a name="FNanchor_1_17" id="FNanchor_1_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_17" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> This beautiful place formerly belonged to Mr. Pitt, and abounds
in local recollections of the great Minister in the shape of 'Pitt's Oak,'
'Pitt's Well,' &amp;c. It is close to Hayes, where his father, the great Lord
Chatham, lived and died. Nobody is here but Pemberton Leigh.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_17" id="Footnote_1_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_17"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [Lord Cranworth at this time occupied Holwood as a summer
residence.]</p></div>


<p>I asked the Chancellor what was the real history of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> Life Peerage last year,
and he told me that it originated in his finding great inconvenience from
himself and Lord St. Leonards frequently sitting together in the House of Lords
without any third, and as St. Leonards invariably opposed his view of every case
great injustice was often done to suitors, and he urged on Palmerston the
expediency of giving them some assistance. Palmerston said it would be a good
opportunity for making some Life Peers. Wensleydale was willing to retire from
the Bench and to accept a Life Peerage, so it was determined to create him a
Peer for life only, and they did this without the slightest idea that any
objection would be made in any quarter. He owned that he regretted this design
had not been abandoned at once when the storm of opposition began. I told him
that I had no doubt there would have been no opposition if he had imparted the
intentions of Government to some of the Law Lords, and obtained their
acquiescence, for Lyndhurst would certainly not have objected, having himself
told me that he meant to comply with Parke's request to him to introduce him to
the House of Lords. The Chancellor said this was very likely true, but that he
had never liked the attempt to force it through the House of Lords. He thought
the opposition had originated with Campbell, who had probably forgotten that he
had recorded his own opinion, in his 'Lives of the Chancellors,' that Life
Peerages would be advisable in certain cases.</p>

<p><i>September 22nd.</i>&mdash;I am just returned from Doncaster, Bretby, and Wilby. The
Indian mail arrived on Monday last, just as I was starting for Doncaster. The
news it brought at first appeared rather good, but when it all came out it
seemed so chequered with good and evil, that it produced great despondency.
Still it is a curious circumstance (which I have heard no one else remark) that,
with all the deep interest universally felt on account of this Sepoy war, not
only as it regards our national interests, but out of feeling and sympathy for
the vast numbers of our countrymen and women exposed to its horrors and dangers,
it does not produce the same degree of enthusiasm as the Crimean War did,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> in
which we had no real interest concerned, and which was only a gigantic folly on
our part. People are very anxious about this war, and earnestly desire that the
mutiny may be put down and punished, but they regard the war itself with
aversion and horror, whereas they positively took pleasure in the war against
Russia, and were ready to spend their last guinea in carrying it on. A
subscription has been set on foot, but although there never was an occasion on
which it might have been expected that vast sums would be subscribed, the
contributions have been comparatively small in amount, and it seems probable
that a much less sum will be produced for the relief of the Indian sufferers
than the Patriotic Fund or any of the various subscriptions made for purposes
connected with the Crimean War. I was so struck with the backwardness of the
Government in rewarding General Havelock for his brilliant exploits, that I
wrote to George Lewis and urged him to press his colleagues to confer some
honour upon him and promote him.</p>

<p>I am on the point of starting for Balmoral, summoned for a Council to order <i>a
day of humiliation</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VISIT TO SCOTLAND.</div>

<p><i>Gordon Castle, September 27th.</i>&mdash;I left town on Tuesday afternoon, and slept
that night at York, on Wednesday at Perth, and on Thursday posted to Balmoral,
where I arrived between two and three o'clock. Granville, Panmure, and Ben
Stanley formed the Council. Granville told me the Queen wished that the day
appointed should be a Sunday, but Palmerston said it must be on a weekday, and
very reluctantly she gave way. What made the whole thing more ridiculous was,
that she gave a ball (to the gillies and tenants) the night before this Council.
The outside of the new house at Balmoral, in the Scotch and French style, is
pretty enough, but the inside has but few rooms, and those very small, not
uncomfortable, and very simply decorated; the place and environs are pretty. In
the afternoon I drove over to Invercauld with Phipps. On Friday morning came on
here, by post, by rail, and by mail. Without any beauty, this is rather a fine
place, and the house very comfortable.</p>


<p><i>September 28th.</i>&mdash;Went to Elgin to see the fine old ruin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> of the Cathedral,
which is very grand, and must have been magnificent. It was built in the
beginning of the thirteenth century, burnt down, and rebuilt in the fourteenth.
I see they have done all I wanted to have done for General Havelock. He has got
a good service pension, is made Major-General and K.C.B.</p>


<p><i>Dunrobin Castle, October 2nd.</i>&mdash;I came here from Gordon Castle on Wednesday,
by sea from Burghead to the Little Ferry, a very tiresome way of travelling, the
delays being detestable. Have long been most desirous of seeing this place,
which has quite equalled my expectations, for it is a most princely possession,
and the Castle exceedingly beautiful and moreover very comfortable. I start for
London to-morrow morning with a long journey before me.</p>

<p>The Indian news of this week as bad and promises as ill as well can be, and I
expect worse each mail that comes. We are justly punished for our ambition and
encroaching spirit, but it must be owned we struggle gallantly for what we have
perhaps unjustly acquired. Europe behaves well to us, for though we have made
ourselves universally odious by our insolence and our domination, and our long
habit of bullying all the world, nobody triumphs over us in the hour of our
distress, and even Russia, who has no cause to feel anything but ill will
towards us, evinces her regret and sympathy in courteous terms. Whatever the
result of this contest may be, it will certainly absorb all our efforts and
occupy our full strength and power so that we shall not be able to take any
active or influential part in European affairs for some time to come. The rest
of the Great Powers will have it in their power to settle everything as seems
meet to them, without troubling themselves about us and our opinions. For the
present we are reduced to the condition of an insignificant Power. It is certain
that if this mutiny had taken place two years earlier, we could not have engaged
at all in the Russian War.</p>


<p><i>London, October 6th.</i>&mdash;I left Dunrobin after breakfast on Saturday morning,
3rd inst., and arrived in London on Monday (yesterday) at 11 <span class="smcap">a.m</span>. My journey was
after this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> wise: We (i.e. Mr. Marshall of the Life Guards, an aide-de-camp of
Lord Carlisle's, who travelled from Dunrobin with me) got into the mail at
Golspie and took our places to Inverness. At Tain, the first stage, we walked
on, leaving the coach to overtake us. After walking three miles, and no coach
coming, we got alarmed, and on enquiry of the first man we fell in with, found
we had come the wrong way, and that the mail had gone on. We started on our
return to Tain, and falling in with a good Samaritan in the shape of a banker in
that place, who was driving in the opposite direction, he took us up in his gig,
and drove us back to the inn, where we took post, and followed the mail to
Inverness, where we arrived an hour after it. There we slept, and at five
minutes before five on Sunday morning we were in the mail again, and arrived at
Perth at six o'clock, making 117 miles in thirteen hours. In twenty minutes more
we were in the mail train, and reached Euston Square safe and sound at eleven
o'clock, doing the distance between Perth and London in seventeen and a half
hours. I have seen a vast deal of very beautiful scenery of all sorts, but the
most beautiful of all (and I never saw anything more lovely anywhere) is the
road from Blair Athol to Dunkeld, which includes the pass of Killiecrankie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">REINFORCEMENTS FOR INDIA.</div>

<p>I fell in with Granville and Clarendon at Watford, and got into their carriage.
Of course my first enquiries were about India, when they told me that the
general impression was not quite so unfavourable as that produced by the first
telegraphic intelligence. Clarendon said that if it was possible for Havelock to
maintain himself a short time longer, and that reinforcements arrived in time to
save the beleaguered places, the tide would turn and Delhi would fall; but if he
should be crushed, Agra, Lucknow, and other threatened places would fall with
renewals of the Cawnpore horrors, and in that case the unlimited spread of the
mutiny would be irrepressible, Madras and Bombay would revolt, all the scattered
powers would rise up everywhere, and all would be lost. We both agreed that the
next would probably be decisive accounts for weal or for woe. I told Granville<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
afterwards that I was glad to see they had called out more militia, but
regretted they had not done more, when he said that he was inclined to take the
same view, from which it was evident to me that there has been difference of
opinion in the Cabinet as to the extent to which the calling out of the militia
should be carried. I urged him to press on his colleagues a more extensive
measure. It is evident that public opinion will back them up in gathering
together as great a force as possible in this emergency, regardless of expense,
and at all events the course of this Government is not embarrassed and annoyed
as that of another Government was three years ago in reference to the Crimean
War. As a very true article in a very sensible paper set forth, the difference
between then and now is, that the Government of Palmerston has fair play, while
that of Lord Aberdeen never had it. The Press, and public opinion goaded and
inflamed by the Press, treated the latter with the most flagrant injustice,
while Palmerston and the whole Government, out of regard for him, are treated
with every sort of consideration and confidence.</p>


<p><i>London, October 19th.</i>&mdash;I spent last week at Newmarket; the details of the last
Indian news which arrived there put people in better spirits, but they were too
much occupied with the business of the place to think much about India. Returned
to town on Friday, and went to The Grove yesterday; had some talk with
Clarendon, who said Palmerston was very offhand in his views of Indian affairs,
and had jumped to the conclusion that the Company must be extinguished. At the
Cabinet on Friday last he said, 'They need not meet again for some time, but
they must begin to think of how to deal with India when the revolt was put down.
Of course everybody must see that the India Company must be got rid of, and
Vernon Smith would draw up a scheme in reference thereto.' This brief
announcement did not meet with any response, and there was no disposition to
come to such rapid and peremptory conclusions, but it seemed not worth while to
raise any discussion about it then.</p>

<p>Clarendon then talked of the Court, and confirmed what I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> had heard before,
going into more detail. He said that the manner in which the Queen in her own
name, but with the assistance of the Prince, exercised her functions, was
exceedingly good, and well became her position and was eminently useful. She
held each Minister to the discharge of his duty and his responsibility to her,
and constantly desired to be furnished with accurate and detailed information
about all important matters, keeping a record of all the reports that were made
to her, and constantly recurring to them, e.g. she would desire to know what the
state of the Navy was, and what ships were in readiness for active service, and
generally the state of each, ordering returns to be submitted to her from all
the arsenals and dockyards, and again weeks or months afterwards referring to
these returns, and desiring to have everything relating to them explained and
accounted for, and so throughout every department. In this practice Clarendon
told me he had encouraged her strenuously. This is what none of her predecessors
ever did, and it is in fact the act of Prince Albert, who is to all intents and
purposes King, only acting entirely in her name. All his views and notions are
those of a Constitutional Sovereign, and he fulfils the duties of one, and at
the same time makes the Crown an entity, and discharges the functions which
properly belong to the Sovereign. I told Clarendon that I had been told the
Prince had upon many occasions rendered the most important services to the
Government, and had repeatedly prevented their getting into scrapes of various
sorts. He said it was perfectly true, and that he had written some of the ablest
papers he had ever read.</p>

<p>Clarendon said he had recently been very much pleased with the Duke of
Cambridge, who had shown a great deal of sense and discretion, and a very
accurate knowledge of the details of his office, and that he was a much better
Commander-in-Chief than Hardinge. He had been lately summoned to the Cabinet on
many occasions, and had given great satisfaction there. Clarendon talked of
Vernon Smith, of whom he has no elevated opinion, but still thinks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> him not
without merit, and that at this moment it would not be easy to replace him by
some one clearly better fitted. He takes pains, is rather clever, and did better
in the House of Commons than anybody gave him credit for last session; he makes
himself well informed upon everything about his office, and is never at a loss
to answer any questions that are put to him, and to answer them satisfactorily.</p>


<div class="sidenote">ATTACKS ON LORD CANNING.</div>

<p><i>November 2nd.</i>&mdash;Gout in my hand has prevented my writing anything, and adding
some trifling particulars to what I have written above. In the meantime has
arrived the news of the capture of Delhi, but though we have received it now a
week ago we are still unacquainted with the particulars. All the advantages of
the electric telegraph are dearly paid for by the agonies of suspense which are
caused by the long intervals between the arrival of general facts and of their
particular details. It still remains to be seen whether the results of this
success turn out on the whole to be as advantageous as it appears to be
brilliant. The Press goes on attacking Canning with great asperity and
injustice, and nobody here defends him. Though I am not a very intimate or
particular friend of his, I think him so unfairly and ungenerously treated that
I mean to make an effort to get him such redress as the case admits of, and the
only thing which occurs to me is that Palmerston, as head of the Government,
should take the opportunity of the Lord Mayor's dinner to vindicate him, and
assume the responsibility of his acts. His 'Clemency' proclamation, as it is
stupidly and falsely called, was, I believe, not only proper and expedient, but
necessary, and I expect he will be able to vindicate himself completely from all
the charges which the newspapers have brought against him, but in the meantime
they will have done him all the mischief they can. Amongst other things
Clarendon told me at The Grove, he said, in reference to Canning's war against
the press, that the license of the Indian press was intolerable, not of the
native press only, but the English in Bengal. Certain papers are conducted there
by low, disaffected people, who publish the most gross, false, and malignant
attacks on the Government, which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> translated into the native languages, and
read extensively in the native regiments, and amongst the natives generally, and
that to put down this pest was an absolute necessity.</p>


<p><i>November 4th.</i>&mdash;I have been speaking to Granville about Canning, and urged him
to move Palmerston to stand forth in his defence at the Lord Mayor's dinner on
the 9th. This morning he received a very strong and pressing letter from
Clanricarde, in the same sense in which I had been urging him, and a very good
letter, and this he is going to send to Palmerston. Clanricarde is struck, as I
am, with the fact that nobody and no newspaper has said a word in Canning's
favour, and he sees as I have done all the damage which has already been done to
him by the long and uncontradicted course of abuse and reproach with which the
press has teemed.</p>


<p><i>Hatchford, November 8th.</i>&mdash;Granville made a speech in defence of Canning, at a
dinner given at the Mansion House to the Duke of Cambridge. He writes me word it
was 'rather uphill work,' and I was told it was not very well received, but
nevertheless it produced an effect, and it acted as a check upon the 'Times,'
which without retracting (which it never does) has considerably mitigated its
violence. It was the first word that has been said for Canning in public, and it
has evidently been of great use to him.</p>

<p>The most interesting event during the last few days is the failure of the
attempted launch of the big ship (now called 'Leviathan),' and it is not a
little remarkable that all the <i>great</i> experiments recently made have proved
failures. Besides this one of the ship, there was a few weeks ago the cracking
of the bell (Big Ben) for the Houses of Parliament, and not long before that the
failure of the submarine telegraph in the attempt to lay it down in the sea. The
bell will probably be replaced without much difficulty, but it is at present
doubtful whether it will be found possible to launch the ship at all, and
whether the telegraphic cable can ever be completed.</p>


<p><i>November 10th.</i>&mdash;Palmerston pronounced a glowing eulogium on Canning last night
at the Lord Mayor's dinner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> which will infallibly stop the current of abuse
against him. It has already turned the 'Times.' He seems to have been induced to
do this by the great pressure brought to bear on him, for otherwise he had no
desire to stand forth and oppose public opinion and the press; but Clarendon,
Lansdowne, and others all urged him strenuously to support Canning, and he did
it handsomely enough. His speech in other respects was an injudicious one, full
of jactance and bow-wow, but well enough calculated to draw cheers from a
miscellaneous audience.</p>


<div class="sidenote">PALMERSTON'S SPEECH AT THE MANSION HOUSE.</div>

<p><i>November 11th.</i>&mdash;I was told yesterday that Palmerston's swaggering speech would
produce a bad effect in France, and those whom I have spoken to agree in
thinking it very ill-timed and in very bad taste. It is the more objectionable
because he might have said something very different that would have been very
becoming and true. He might have observed upon the remarkable good taste and
forbearance which had been so conspicuous in all foreign nations towards us,
even those who may be supposed to be least friendly to us, or those whom we have
most outraged by our violent and insulting language or conduct. It is at once
creditable to other countries and honourable to us that no disposition has been
shown in any quarter to act differently towards us, or to avail themselves of
what they may suppose to be our weakness and difficulty; but, on the contrary,
the same consideration and deference has been shown to us as if there had been
no Indian outbreak to absorb our resources. Our position in Europe is not only
as high as ever, but no one shows any disposition to degrade or diminish it; and
while this is a gratifying homage to us and a flattering recognition of our
power, it is, or at least ought to be, calculated to inspire us with amicable
sentiments, and to be an inducement to us to depart from the insolent and
offensive tone which has so long prevailed here, and which has made England
universally an object of aversion. It was of course impossible that some
expressions should not be given here and there and now and then to such
feelings, but on the whole we have no reason to complain, but much the contrary;
not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> even in Russia, whose power and pride we have so deeply wounded, and whom
we have so outraged by every topic and expression of insult and injury which the
bitterest hatred could suggest, has there been anything like asperity, or any
rejoicing over our misfortunes.</p>


<p><i>Frognal, November 14th.</i>&mdash;The news of the capture of Delhi and the relief of
Lucknow excited a transport of delight and triumph, and everybody jumped to the
conclusion that the Indian contest was virtually at an end. Granville told me he
thought there would be no more fighting, and that the work was done. I was not
so sanguine, and though I thought the result of the contest was now secure, I
thought we should still have a great deal on our hands and much more fighting to
hear of before the curtain could drop. But I was not prepared to hear the dismal
news which arrived to-day, and which has so cruelly damped the public joy and
exultation. It appears that Havelock is in great danger and the long suffering
garrison of Lucknow not yet out of their peril, for the victory of Havelock had
not been complete, the natives were gathering round the small British force in
vast numbers, and unless considerable reinforcements could be speedily brought
up, the condition of the British, both military and civilians, of men, women,
and children, would soon again be one of excessive danger.</p>


<div class="sidenote">SUSPENSION OF THE BANK ACT.</div>

<p><i>The Grove, November 15th.</i>&mdash;I talked with Clarendon about the Government letter
to the Bank<a name="FNanchor_1_18" id="FNanchor_1_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_18" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and the state of financial affairs. It is evident that Clarendon
knows very little about these questions, and takes very little part in them, but
he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> told me one curious fact. A letter which appeared about a week ago,
addressed by the Emperor of the French to his Finance Minister, made a great
sensation here. In it the Emperor deprecated all empirical measures for the
purpose of meeting the prevailing difficulties, financial and commercial, at
Paris. About a week before this Clarendon received a letter from Cowley, who
said that he had been conversing with the Emperor and with Walewski on these
matters, and Walewski had begged him (by the desire of the Emperor) to write to
Clarendon and request the advice of the English Government as to the course he
should adopt. Clarendon said that George Lewis was out of town, but as there
could be no delay, he sent his private secretary to the Governor and Deputy
Governor of the Bank, and requested their advice and opinion. They said it was
so important they would go down to the Foreign Office, which they did, when they
told Clarendon that their advice was that the Emperor should insist on the Bank
of France following as nearly as possible the example of the Bank of England, to
keep their rates of discount high, and to avoid all rash experiments of any
kind. He wrote to Cowley accordingly, who communicated the answer, and judging
from the dates it would appear that the Emperor's letter was the consequence of
the advice so tendered. But Clarendon seemed to think that the appearance of the
Government letter was rather awkward, and would appear to the French Government
very inconsistent with our communication to them. However, it will probably be
easy to afford satisfactory explanations on this head. The measure itself here
has apparently had the desired success, and they hope the panic and distress
will gradually subside, without any more mischief happening. Lewis thinks that
the best mode of dealing with Peel's Act will be to retain it, but to give a
power to the Queen in Council to relax it in the same manner as has been now
twice done by the interposition of Government, whenever an urgent necessity
should arise, and I suppose this is the course that will be adopted, though not
without a great deal of discussion and diversity of opinion. I have hitherto
said nothing about the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> curious and important state of affairs in America
and in this country, because I am too ignorant of financial questions to talk
about them, and I have not been apprised of any facts beyond what all the world
knows that it was worth while to record, but this anecdote of the French
Government and our own appears sufficiently curious to have a place in this
book.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_18" id="Footnote_1_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_18"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [On the 12th of November a letter was addressed to the Governors of
the Bank of England by Lord Palmerston and Sir George Cornewall Lewis, the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, empowering the Bank to exceed the limits prescribed
by the Bank Act of 1844 (if necessary) to meet the demands for discount and
advances on approved security. This measure was rendered necessary by the
extensive failures which had recently taken place, and the severe pressure on
the money market. On the 4th November discount had advanced to 9 per cent. The
Issue Department made over to the Banking Department two millions in excess of
the statutable amount, of which about one million was advanced to the public. On
the 1st December the whole amount was repaid. Parliament was summoned to pass a
Bill of Indemnity, and public confidence was restored.]</p></div>


<p><i>November 17th.</i>&mdash;A council was held yesterday at Windsor to summon Parliament,
where I found the ministers much dejected at the news from India. There was a
letter from Colin Campbell, expressing great alarm at the position of Outram and
Havelock, whom he thought to be in a great scrape, though without any fault of
theirs, and there was also a report from Sir John Lawrence that affairs were in
a ticklish state in the Punjaub, and expressing a great anxiety for
reinforcements, which he had very little prospect of getting; in short the
apparently bright sky in which we were rejoicing only a few days ago seems to be
obscured by black clouds, and the great result to be as uncertain as ever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CLAYTON-BULWER TREATY.</div>

<p>I met Clarendon at dinner this evening, when he told me that affairs were in a
bad state in the City, and that Lewis had received very unsatisfactory accounts,
so that it is not clear that the Government letter is producing the good which
at first seemed to be following from it. There is a good deal of uneasiness in
the financial and commercial world and no confidence. The very prudence of the
trading community in arresting the course of production is becoming a source of
distress, for already vast numbers of people are out of employment, or working
short time with reduced wages. The prices of everything are falling, consumption
will be diminished, and the revenue must be diminished likewise, while our
expenses cannot but be increased by the war. A general cry is getting up for
making India pay for the expense of this Indian war, which, even supposing it to
be just and reasonable, will make the ultimate settlement of the Indian question
more difficult, and a measure little calculated to reconcile the native
population to our rule. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> as if we had not embarrassments enough on our
hands, America is going to add to them, for President Buchanan, who hates
England with a mortal antipathy, threatens to repudiate the Clayton-Bulwer
Treaty upon the pretence that we have not abided by its conditions, and if he
proposes to the Senate to declare it null and void, the Senate will do so at his
bidding. This would be a flagrant violation of good faith, and of the
obligations by which all civilized nations consider themselves bound. If this
event happens, it will place us in a very perplexing dilemma, especially after
Palmerston's absurd bravado and confident boastings of our power, for we are not
in a condition to enable us to take a highline corresponding with that lofty
language, and we shall have to eat humble pie and submit to the affront.
Hitherto all other nations and governments have behaved to us as well and as
respectfully as we could desire, and far more than we deserve; but if America
bullies us in one instance, and we are found pocketing the affront, it is by no
means improbable that other governments will begin to take advantage of our
weakness, and adopt towards us a conduct injurious to our interests or a tone
galling to our pride.<a name="FNanchor_1_19" id="FNanchor_1_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_19" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_19" id="Footnote_1_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_19"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [These apprehensions were unfounded. Mr. Buchanan did not seek to
abrogate the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty with reference to the eventual construction
of a passage through the Isthmus of Central America, and the neutral character
of that undertaking, which is now said to be in progress by the Canal of Panama,
has remained unchanged to the present time.]</p></div>


<p><i>November 25th.</i>&mdash;Last week I went to Ampthill from Wednesday till Saturday; on
Saturday to The Grove, with the Duke of Bedford, the Lewises, Charles Villiers,
and Ben Stanley. The Duke of Bedford told me he was very uneasy about his
brother John, who seemed in an irritable frame of mind, and disposed to wage war
against the Government when Parliament meets.<a name="FNanchor_1_20" id="FNanchor_1_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_20" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> He told Sir George Grey the
other day that they would not find him friendly. Clarendon told me of a
conversation he had recently had with the Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> <i>ï¿½ propos</i> of Palmerston's
health, concerning which Her Majesty was very uneasy, and what could be done in
the not impossible contingency of his breaking down. It is a curious change from
what we saw a few years ago, that she is become almost affectionately anxious
about the health of Palmerston, whose death might then have been an event to be
hailed with satisfaction. Clarendon said she might well be solicitous about it,
for if anything happened to Palmerston she would be placed in the greatest
difficulty. She said that in such a case she should look to <i>him</i>, and expect
him to replace Palmerston, on which Clarendon said he was glad she had broached
the subject, as it gave him an opportunity of saying what he was very anxious to
impress upon her mind, and that was the absolute impossibility of his
undertaking such an office, against which he enumerated various objections. He
told her that Derby could not form a Government, and if she had the misfortune
to lose Palmerston, nothing remained for her to do but to send for John Russell
and put him at the head of the Government. She expressed her great repugnance to
this, and especially to make him Prime Minister. Clarendon then entreated her to
conquer her repugnance, and to be persuaded that it would never do to offer him
anything else, which he neither would nor could accept; that the necessity was
to have a man who could lead the House of Commons, and there was no other but
him; that Lord John had consented to take a subordinate office under Lord
Aberdeen, who was his senior in age, and occupied a high position, but he would
never consent to take office under him (Clarendon), and the proposal he would
consider as an insult. For every reason, therefore, he urged her, if driven to
apply to him at all, to do it handsomely, to place the whole thing in his hands,
and to give him her full confidence and support. He appears to have convinced
her that this is the proper course, and he gave me to understand that if Lord
John acts with prudence and moderation all the present Government would accept
him for their head, and Clarendon is so anxious that this should be the turn
affairs should take, that he urged me to talk to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> Duke of Bedford about it,
and to get him to exert all his influence with Lord John to conduct himself in
such a manner as shall conduce to his restoration to office at a future time. I
had only time to exchange a few words with the Duke before we parted the next
morning, and we agreed that I should write him a letter on the subject which he
may show to Lord John if he sees fit to do so. I went to Wrotham on Monday, and
yesterday penned an epistle to be shown to Lord John, in which I set forth his
position, and dilated on the great importance to himself and to the country of
his conducting himself with patience and forbearance, and of his abstaining from
any such vexatious opposition to the Government as might render his future union
with them impossible. It remains to be seen whether my remonstrance (which I
tried to couch in terms that would not be disagreeable to Lord John) will
produce any effect.<a name="FNanchor_2_21" id="FNanchor_2_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_21" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_20" id="Footnote_1_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_20"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [Lord John Russell had taken office in Lord Palmerston's first
Administration as Colonial Secretary, but he resigned on June 13, 1855, and
remained out of office.]</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_2_21" id="Footnote_2_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_21"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> [These speculations are curious, but happily the apprehensions
caused by the supposed state of Lord Palmerston's health were unfounded, for
with the short interval of the second Derby Government in 1858 and 1859, he
continued to hold office and to discharge the duties of Prime Minister with his
accustomed vigour and success until his death in October 1865, when he was
succeeded by Lord Russell. At this particular moment (1857) the latent danger of
the Government lay, not in the failing health of Lord Palmerston, but in an
unforeseen occurrence which caused the unexpected defeat of Lord Palmerston's
Ministry within four months of this date, and the accession of Lord Derby and
his friends to office.]</p></div>


<div class="sidenote">LORD JOHN RUSSELL IN OPPOSITION.</div>

<p><i>Hitchinbrook, November 28th.</i>&mdash;I came here to-day from Riddlesworth, where I
have now been for the first time for twenty years. I received there two letters
from the Duke of Bedford, the first telling me he should show, and the second
that he had shown, my letter to Lord John. He received it graciously, saying he
agreed with almost all I said, but that it was easier to give than it was to
take such advice, and that he had been blamed by certain persons for not having
given more opposition to the Government last year on some questions than he had
done, especially to the Persian War; but I rather infer on the whole that my
letter made some impression on him, though it remains to be seen how much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>The last news from India is as good as could be expected, and the current there
has evidently turned. I met Martin Smith (Indian Director) at Riddlesworth, and
had much talk with him about Indian affairs. It is clear that the Company do not
mean to submit to be summarily extinguished without a struggle. He told me that
with regard to the great subject, the sending out troops by sailing vessels
instead of by steamers, which is made matter of bitter reproach against the
Directors, the fault lay entirely with the Government. The Directors wanted to
send 10,000 men across Egypt, and the Government would not do it. They proposed
it formally to the Board of Control, who referred it to the Foreign Office, and
Clarendon said it could not be done on account of certain political
considerations which rendered it inexpedient, so that if the Directors could
have had their own way the thing would have been done. There may have been good
grounds for the refusal of the Government, but in this instance the double
Government was productive only of a sacrifice of Indian to Imperial interests,
and it will not be easy to draw from this transaction any argument in favour of
abolishing the East India Company and the Leadenhall Street Administration.</p>


<p><i>London, December 2nd.</i>&mdash;Yesterday morning Lord Sydney received a letter from
Lady Canning, who said that although undoubtedly many horrible things had
happened in India, the exaggeration of them had been very great, and that she
had read for the first time in the English newspapers stories of atrocities of
which she had never heard at Calcutta, and that statements made in India had
turned out to be pure inventions and falsehoods. Yet our papers publish
everything that is sent to them without caring whether it may be true or false,
and the credulous public swallow it all without the slightest hesitation and
doubt. Shaftesbury too, who is a prodigious authority with the public, and who
has all the religious and pseudo-religious people at his back, does his utmost
to make the case out to be as bad as possible and to excite the rage and
indignation of the masses to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> highest pitch. He is not satisfied with the
revolting details with which the Press has been teeming, but complains that more
of them have not been detailed and described, and that the particulars of
mutilation and violation have not been more copiously and circumstantially given
to the world. I have never been able to comprehend what his motives are for
talking in this strange and extravagant strain, but it is no doubt something
connected with the grand plan of Christianizing India, in the furtherance of
which the High Church and the Low Church appear to be bidding against each
other; and as their united force will in all probability be irresistible, so
they will succeed in making any Government in India impossible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A QUEEN'S SPEECH.</div>

<p>B&mdash;&mdash; showed me the Draft of the Queen's Speech this evening after dinner.
Cobbett in his Grammar produces examples of bad English taken from Kings'
Speeches, which he says might be expected to be the best written, but generally
are the worst written documents in the world. It would be difficult to produce
any former Speech more deplorably composed than this one. Long sentences, full
of confusion, and of which the meaning is not always clear, and some faults of
grammar for which a schoolboy would be whipped. B&mdash;&mdash; was so struck by one I
pointed out that he said he would beg Palmerston to alter it. If this Speech
escapes severe criticism and ridicule I shall be much surprised, as I am already
that George Lewis, who has so lately been a literary critic, and is a correct
writer himself, should have allowed it to pass in its present shape, and indeed
the sentence he himself put in about his own business is as bad as any other
part of it.</p>

<p>I have no idea what they mean to propose about the Bank Charter Act, but if it
be what Lewis told me some time ago, to give the Queen the power of suspending
the Act by Order in Council, I much doubt if they will carry such a proposal,
and it appears to me on reflexion thoroughly unconstitutional, and as such I
expect it will be vehemently attacked by all the opponents and the
quasi-opponents of Government, and indeed by all except those who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> prepared
to follow Palmerston with blind submission, and to vote for anything rather than
allow him to be put in jeopardy. John Russell, for instance, would hardly be
able to resist the temptation of falling foul of such a proposal, though he
would approve of their having followed a precedent which he had himself set in a
case somewhat similar, though in some respects less urgent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A BAD WINTER.</div>

<p><i>London, December 4th</i>, 1857.&mdash;Parliament opened yesterday, very quietly, and
at present a quiet session seems probable, but such appearances are often
fallacious. The most alarming consideration is the probability of a very hard
and hungry winter for the working classes, vast numbers of people being already
out of employment. I met Sir James Shuttleworth yesterday, who knows a great
deal about Lancashire, where he lives, and he told me that though the distress
was considerable and threatening to increase, the conduct of the people was
admirable. There was no disaffection or bad feeling towards the upper classes
and employers; they seemed to have greatly improved in good sense and
reflection, and were satisfied of the sympathy felt for them, and the
disposition entertained by the rich to do all in their power to alleviate the
distress of the poor. And he stated (what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> seemed to me a curious fact) that
they preferred that the time of working should be shortened, or even mills
closed, rather than a general reduction in the rate of wages. This moral
condition of the labouring classes is a most satisfactory sign of the times.</p>

<p>The Duke of Bedford has just been here, and tells me Lord John is in a better
frame of mind, and has already done two sensible things. He has given notice to
some of his supporters that he will have nothing to do with the organisation of
any party, and he has responded to an invitation of Vernon Smith's by a promise
to impart to him his opinion and advice upon Indian affairs, and the best mode
of providing for the future government of that country.</p>


<p><i>December 6th.</i>&mdash;John Russell has begun well in the House of Commons and <i>si sic
omnia</i> he will put himself in a good position, but it is impossible to rely upon
him. At present his disposition to the Government appears friendly. I had a
conversation about him and his future relations with the Government last night
with B&mdash;&mdash;. I infer from what dropped from him that he thinks the probability of
Palmerston's breaking down is not a remote and unlikely one. I do not think he
considers him broken in health, but that he thinks the strength of his intellect
is impaired, and that he begins to show signs of decay to those who have the
means of observing them. He particularly noticed the failure of his memory, and
he said, what I have no doubt is true, that he will never be himself conscious,
still less acknowledge, that his faculties are less vigorous and active than
they were. What the nature and amount of the decay in him is I know not, and
they will not say, but from the uneasy feeling, and these speculations as to
future contingencies among his colleagues, I am sure they are prepared for
something. B&mdash;&mdash; said if the case occurred there were only two men who could be
Minister, Derby or Clarendon, and he fancies that John Russell might be induced
to take office under Clarendon, and he does not believe that Clarendon really
means what he says when he expresses his extreme reluctance to take the post, or
that he would not in reality prefer it even to the Foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> Office. He treats
his scruples as a sort of <i>nolo episcopari</i>, in which I think he is partially,
but not entirely, right. There can be no doubt that in the present state of
affairs it is much to be desired that Palmerston should be able to go on. I was
amused by a trifling incident, so very Palmerstonian, told me the other day. I
have already alluded to the bad writing in the Queen's Speech, and it seems one
phrase was criticised and altered in the Cabinet, but when he got back to his
office he altered the alteration, and made it as it was before. I am not sure
that the alteration was not the one suggested by B&mdash;&mdash; upon the strength of my
criticism, and that Palmerston declined to alter the passage.</p>


<div class="sidenote">TRANSFER OF INDIA TO THE CROWN.</div>

<p><i>December 7th.</i>&mdash;I called on Lord Grey in the morning and dined with Lyndhurst
in the evening, and had much talk with both of them about the pending questions,
Reform, India, Bank Act. Lord Grey is bringing out a book upon Reform. Lyndhurst
is decidedly against any strong and subversive measure about India, and is for
improving and not upsetting the present system. Public opinion, led by the
Press, has hitherto leant to the dissolution of the Company and the Directorial
Government; but as time advances and the extreme difficulty of concocting
another system becomes apparent, people begin to dread the idea of destroying an
ancient system, without any certainty of a better one replacing it, and I think
there is a general feeling of alarm at the notion of the Indian Empire being
placed under the direction of such a man as Vernon Smith; more, indeed, than is
quite just and called for, as his talents, though of a second-rate calibre, are
not so low as is supposed, and he is not the cipher in his office he is thought
to be, but is well enough acquainted with all its details, and always able to
explain everything to the Cabinet clearly and correctly. But these merits, which
are those of a diligent clerk, are far from being sufficient to qualify him for
having the direction of an office which circumstances have rendered by far the
most important and difficult in the whole Government. Till recently the Board of
Control has been looked upon as a very subordinate department, and one of mere
routine, which anybody might fill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> I remember when John Russell offered it to
Graham some years ago, he treated the proposal as an insult.</p>


<p><i>December 8th.</i>&mdash;I went to the House of Lords last night and heard for the first
time Ellenborough speak&mdash;an admirable style of speaking. It was a good night for
Canning. The 'Times' has turned right round and defends him, finding the
Government are in earnest in doing so. The account of Lucknow just come by
telegram is very alarming, and keeps one in a state of nervous excitement,
difficult to describe.</p>


<p><i>London, December 17th.</i>&mdash;Though the last advices from India were satisfactory
as far as they went, it is generally understood that the next mail must bring
the account of a bloody battle at or near Lucknow, in which, though no one
doubts that the British will be victorious, it is certain that there will be
great loss of life. Sanguine people and the Press, with hardly any exception,
imagine that this anticipated victory will terminate the contest and leave only
some straggling conflicts to go on for a short time longer, ending by a speedy
suppression of the rebellion. In this expectation I do not share, but, on the
contrary, believe it will be a protracted affair, not indeed doubtful in its
ultimate result, but which will cost as much time and money and many men, for
all who know anything of the matter tell us that the wear and tear in India is
enormous, and that a continual stream of reinforcements must be poured into the
country to keep the army in a state of efficiency. Captain Lowe, lately
aide-de-camp to poor George Anson, and who was in the storm of Delhi, an
intelligent officer, confirms all these notions, and he says that nothing can be
more inexpedient than the scheme, propounded here with great confidence, of
forming the native force, on which we are hereafter to rely, of Sikhs instead of
Hindoos. He says that inasmuch as they are very brave and excellent soldiers, it
would only be to place ourselves in a state of far greater danger and
uncertainty, for though the Sikhs have proved very faithful to us, and rendered
excellent service, it is impossible to predict how long this humour may last,
and whether circumstances may not arise to induce them to throw off our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> yoke
and assert their own independence. It is marvellous and providential that on
this occasion the Sikhs were disposed to side with us instead of against us, for
if they had taken the latter course, it would have been all up and nothing could
have saved us. <i>ï¿½ propos</i> of this consideration he told me a curious anecdote. A
Sikh was talking to a British officer in a very friendly way, and he said,
'Don't you think it very strange that we, who were so recently fighting against
you, should be now fighting with you? and should you be very much surprised if a
year or two hence you should see us fighting against you again?'</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONVERSATION WITH MR. DISRAELI.</div>

<p>Disraeli called on me a day or two ago, when we had a political chat. He talked
with much contempt of the present Government, except of George Lewis, of whom he
spoke in the highest terms. He said Palmerston's popularity was of a negative
character, and, rather more from the unpopularity of every other public man than
from any peculiar attachment to him; he talked bitterly of Derby's having
declined to take the Government in 1855, which he seemed to consider as an
irreparable blow to his party. He is evidently not without hopes that the
Government may find themselves in some inextricable difficulty about their
Reform Bill, and thinks they will be incapable of concocting an India Bill which
will go down with the country. He does not appear to have made up his mind what
course to take on the Indian question, and it is evident that at present the
Tory party have decided on nothing. The Cabinet has committed the scheme of
Reform to a select number of its members, as was done in 1830, but what they are
doing about India I do not know. There is certainly a difference of opinion
amongst them, as there no doubt is about Reform, but as little doubt that they
are all agreed upon not letting their conflicting opinions break up the
Government.</p>


<p><i>December 21st.</i>&mdash;I called on George Lewis the day before yesterday and had a
long talk with him. He told me that Palmerston had given notice to the Chairs
that the Government had come to the resolution of bringing in a Bill to put an
end to their dominion, and that the plan was to have an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> Indian Secretary of
State with a Council, and the Council to have the distribution of the patronage.
I was surprised to hear him say that he saw no difficulty in the settlement of
the Indian question, either in passing it through Parliament or in producing a
good measure which would work better than the present system, and he said he
wished the other great question they had upon their hands, that of Reform, was
as easy, but that the more they went into it, the more difficult it appeared. I
need not enter into the details which we discussed, as the Bill is not yet
settled, and in a few weeks more it will come forth. He said that the great
misfortune was their having thrown out Locke King's motion this year, for if
they had done what they had originally intended with regard to it, they should
in all probability have laid the question at rest for ten years longer at least,
and he then told me a curious anecdote on this matter, giving an example of
strange levity and incapacity on the part of the Government. When Locke King
brought forward his motion, it was considered in the Cabinet, and they came to a
unanimous resolution to let his bill be read a second time, but to oppose the
amount of his franchise in Committee and raise it from 10<i>l.</i> to 20<i>l.</i>, which
they had no doubt they should carry. On the very night on which the question was
to be moved Lewis went down to the House of Commons with this understanding,
never dreaming that any alteration was contemplated, when George Grey said to
him, 'You know Palmerston is going to oppose Locke King's motion' (for leave to
bring in his Bill). Lewis expressed his surprise, and asked what had happened to
set aside the unanimous agreement come to in the Cabinet. Grey said there had
been a dinner at Charles Wood's, at which certain Ministers were present (whom
he named, but I forget if Palmerston was one), when the question had been
discussed, and the result had been to make a change in their opinions, and
Palmerston had agreed that Locke King should be opposed <i>in limine</i>. This Lewis
told me he regarded as a fatal error, to which they owed the dilemma in which
they found themselves placed. But what struck me most was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> mode of doing
business of such importance, and that there should not be found a single
individual to protest against it, and to resign his office rather than to submit
to be so dragged through the mire; but the present doctrine seems to be that
<i>Palmerston's</i> Government must be held together at any price, and this is the
more curious when it is obvious to me that his colleagues, while conscious of
the difficulty of doing without him, have an exceedingly mean opinion of his
intrinsic value. I told Lewis all that Disraeli had said to me about him as well
as about Palmerston, when he expressed his surprise at the manner in which
Disraeli had spoken of <i>him</i>, for which he was not at all prepared, but said <i>he
estimated Palmerston at his real worth</i>. He told me of Harrowby's resignation on
account of his health, and that his place had been offered to Clanricarde, and
wanted to know if I thought Clanricarde would be objected to.<a name="FNanchor_1_22" id="FNanchor_1_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_22" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> We talked of
the stories which John Russell had heard of, about our being on bad terms with
France, and the Emperor Napoleon out of humour with us, and of Palmerston's
meditating hostile designs against Russia, all of which he said were pure
fabrications, as we were on the best terms with France, and Palmerston
entertained no hostile designs against Russia or any other Power. We both agreed
that our hands were too full to think of any fresh quarrels or aggressions, and
I found him of the same opinion as myself about our arbitrary and dictatorial
system, and of the mischief it had done, and as much with reference to the slave
trade as any other question.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CASE OF THE 'NEWPORT.'</div>

<p>I told him of the slave case just decided in the Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council, and of the sum of money it would cost our Government, to say nothing of
the mortification. He said no doubt Palmerston would proclaim it to be a wrong
decision, and would defend the Foreign Office and all the agents who had been
concerned in the outrage.<a name="FNanchor_2_23" id="FNanchor_2_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_23" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

with costs and damages, and declared that the owners of the ship must look to
the Government for their indemnity. They added that 'merchants who, having
engaged only in a lawful adventure, have been subjected to an unjust and illegal
sentence, are entitled to be indemnified against its consequences, and against
the costs which they have incurred in obtaining its reversal, in relieving
themselves from the heavy pecuniary loss which it inflicted, and from the deep
stain which it cast upon their characters, and that the national honour must be
vindicated at the national expense.']</p></div>

<p><i>Hatchford, December 26th.</i>&mdash;Christmas Day, usually coming in frost and snow,
was yesterday like a fine day in May, the glorious weather being in unison with
the general gladness at the good news from India and the tidings that Lucknow,
with its wounded and its long suffering band of women and children, had been
relieved at last, and for good and all. This news arrived on Christmas Eve, to
make the day itself as merry as it is proverbially said to be.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD NORMANBY'S 'YEAR OF REVOLUTION.'</div>

<p>Brougham has taken Normanby's book, 'A Year of Revolution,' under his
protection, for what reason nobody can divine. He wrote to Mrs. Austin begging
she would exert her influence with her nephew Reeve to get it noticed favourably
in the 'Edinburgh Review,' that it was a good book, had the merit of being true,
and that it was much approved by Louis Napoleon, who had encouraged its being
translated. I had imagined Brougham was improved, but it is evident from his
conduct on this occasion that he is the same man he ever was. The book contains
page after page of matter the most offensive to Guizot and to Louis Philippe and
his family, with which everybody is revolted, and its malice is not redeemed by
literary merit or attractiveness in any shape. That Brougham should take up such
a production is as unaccountable as it is indecent, for he affected to be
exceedingly attached to the Orleans royalties, to be on very intimate terms with
the King, and he treated Guizot with a familiarity quite at variance with good
taste and propriety, and which had excited the astonishment, with no small
disgust, of Guizot himself. It might have been expected that he would have
resented such a production as Normanby's,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> instead of patronising it. He told
Mrs. Austin he could not himself speak to Reeve about it, since he had made the
'Edinburgh Review' the vehicle of a personal attack upon himself. What he
alluded to was, that when Lord Cockburn's life was published an article
(anonymous of course) appeared in the 'Law Magazine' in which Lord Cockburn was
very ill-used, and another in reply to this, and in vindication of Lord
Cockburn, but without a word against Brougham, appeared in the 'Edinburgh.' This
was what he called a personal attack upon himself. He was the author of the
paper in the 'Law Magazine,' but the writer in the 'Edinburgh' had no right to
assume this, or to know anything about it, though as a matter of fact he did
know, or at least had good reason to suspect, that it was penned by Brougham. It
had already been settled that the 'Edinburgh Review' should take no notice
whatever of 'The Year of Revolution,' and Mrs. Austin having sent Brougham's
letter to Reeve, Reeve answered it himself, utterly denying that he had made or
intended to make any attack upon him, and telling him in plain terms what the
general opinion is of Normanby's book.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Guizot writes to Reeve that the book is full of lies, and not worth
notice; that he will take none of what concerns himself alone, but cannot leave
uncontradicted such parts of it as relate to the King, and give utterly false
statements of the relations between the King and himself. He then refers to
various passages which he says are all false, and desires Reeve to show his
letter to Lord Lansdowne, Granville, and me, and to anybody else he thinks fit.
All this will contribute to bring Normanby into a very unpleasant dilemma about
this ill-advised book, and it must be said that it is all Clarendon's fault for
his weakness and good nature in abstaining from renewing his prohibition, and
when Normanby was here giving a sort of tacit consent to its appearance,
although that was accompanied with a strong expression of opinion that it ought
to be suppressed. And now a report has got about that before the book came out
Clarendon read and approved of it, which I requested Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> Austin to deny in the
most peremptory manner, for it was to her that this assertion had been made.<a name="FNanchor_1_24" id="FNanchor_1_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_24" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_24" id="Footnote_1_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_24"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [Lord Normanby had written this narrative of the events of 1847 to
1848 whilst he was Ambassador in Paris, and he proposed to publish it at an
earlier period when he was still in office. But upon this coming to the
knowledge of the Foreign Office, Lord Clarendon (without having read the work)
intimated to Lord Normanby that he could not allow a diplomatic servant of the
Crown of the first rank to publish a polemical narrative of transactions in
which he had been engaged, at any rate whilst he held office. The book therefore
was suppressed for some years. But when Lord Normanby had quitted office, he
felt at liberty to disregard Lord Clarendon's injunction, and the book was
published, to the great detriment of his own reputation.]</p></div>


<div class="sidenote">THE CROWN JEWELS OF HANOVER.</div>

<p><i>December 29th.</i>&mdash;The long-pending dispute about the Crown jewels claimed by the
King of Hanover was settled the other day. The history of it is this. The late
King of Hanover on the death of William IV. claimed these jewels upon the ground
that they were partly belonging to the Crown of Hanover and partly had been
bequeathed to him by Queen Charlotte. Our Government, on behalf of the Queen,
naturally resisted the claim. After a good deal of wrangling they were at last
prevailed on to name a commission to investigate the question, and Lord
Lyndhurst, Lord Langdale, and Chief Justice Tindal were appointed accordingly.
After a considerable delay and a troublesome enquiry, they arrived at a
conclusion, but when they were just about to give their award Chief Justice
Tindal died. Lyndhurst and Langdale were divided in opinion, so no award could
be given. The Chancellor, Lord Cottenham, refused to renew the Commission, and
the matter has stood over ever since. In the present year, however, the
Government thought the matter ought to be decided one way or another, and they
issued a fresh Commission, consisting of Lord Wensleydale, Vice-Chancellor Page
Wood, and Sir Lawrence Peel (ex-Indian judge), and they have given judgement
unanimously in favour of the King of Hanover, i.e., with regard to the bulk of
the jewels, some few seem to have been allotted to the Queen. Lord Wensleydale
came into my room at the Council Office just after they had finished their
award, and told me about it. I asked him if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> they had decided it on <i>evidence</i>
or only by a sort of rough estimate, but he said they had ample evidence, and
they were all quite satisfied upon the point. Last night I asked Lord Lyndhurst
about his share in the question, when he told me their difficulty had been to
make out whether the jewels which Queen Charlotte had disposed of by her will
had really been hers to leave, or whether she had only had the use of them, but
that this had been decided by the discovery of George III.'s will, in which he
expressly left them to her. Tindal entirely agreed with Lyndhurst, and if he had
lived a little longer, judgement would have been given then in favour of
Hanover. Lyndhurst said the Court was very anxious about it, for Prince Albert
had told him the pearls were the finest in Europe. The value of them has been
enormously exaggerated, but is still considerable. Lord Lyndhurst said they were
worth about 150,000<i>l.</i>, and Kielmansegge told me the same thing.</p>

<p>By the Indian papers just arrived it appears that the relief of the Residency of
Lucknow and the deliverance of all who were confined in it was complete, but
there was no great battle (which everybody expected), though much severe
fighting, and Lucknow itself was still untaken. The mutineers, though always
worsted, seem to fight better than they were thought capable of doing, and
everything tends to show that the suppression of the Mutiny is still far from
being accomplished.</p>


<p><i>December 31st.</i>&mdash;I met Clarendon last night, who talked about the Hanoverian
jewel question; he said the Queen was very anxious to know Lord Lyndhurst's
opinion upon the award, so last night I went to his house and asked him, telling
him the reason why. He said he had no doubt the award was correct; that in their
case the jewels were divided into two categories: first, those which came from
George II. and were undoubtedly Hanoverian; and secondly, those which George
III. had given Queen Charlotte. They had heard counsel on both sides, but
neither side chose to produce the will of George III., which they never had
before them, so they were in a difficulty about these latter stones. Tindal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
died the day they were to have met to draw up an award. He and Lyndhurst were
agreed, Langdale doubted. Lyndhurst said he had no doubt if they had had King
George III.'s will, which Wensleydale and his colleagues had before them, they
should all three have agreed, and to the same award.</p>

<p>Clarendon complained of the recent pro-slavery articles in the 'Times,' and told
Delane they were calculated to encourage the French in holding to their African
operations. The French Government had told us that they must have labour, but
they did not care if it was black or brown, and if we would undertake to find
coolies for them in the same way as Mauritius is supplied, they would give up
their scheme. Clarendon said this was fair enough, but it did not get rid of the
difficulty, because it was impossible to get the coolies in sufficient numbers,
and that our own Colonies, which were perishing for want of labour, would
complain loudly, and not unjustly, if we brought the French into competition
with them, thus enhancing the difficulty and the cost of supply to themselves.
The probability then is that the French will go on, and that all other nations
who have the same wants will follow their example, and we shall be reinvolved in
endless remonstrances and squabbles under very disadvantageous circumstances.</p>


<p><i>January 1st</i>.1858.&mdash;It is worth noticing that after a year of fine weather, of
which nobody can recollect the like, this first day of the New Year has opened
like one of a genial spring. This nearly unbroken course of wonderful weather
for about nine or ten months gives rise to many speculations as to its cause,
and no doubt there is some physical cause, although it has not yet been
ascertained.</p>


<p><i>January 5th.</i>&mdash;To-day the winter seems to have set in in earnest.</p>


<div class="sidenote">THE CONTEST IN INDIA.</div>

<p><i>January 7th.</i>&mdash;Not many days ago the 'Times' concluded an article on the Indian
war in these words (it was after describing the relief of the Residence at
Lucknow by Sir Colin Campbell): 'thus ends the Indian Mutiny of 1857;' and
to-day we have the news of Wyndham having been defeated by the Gwalior Force; of
Sir Colin having been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> obliged to quit Lucknow, <i>without having captured it</i>, in
order to repair this check (which he seems to have done very effectually) and
deplorable event; of the death of Havelock, the hero of this war, who, after
escaping unhurt through battle after battle, has succumbed to disease, not
having lived long enough to know all that is said of him and all that has been
done for him here. It is impossible not to feel the loss of this man as if he
belonged to one individually, so deep is the interest which his gallantry and
his brilliant career have excited in every heart.</p>

<p>Every account we receive only confirms the impression that this war will be a
long and difficult affair, and if we are able by our military successes to put
down all opposition and suppress the mutiny thoroughly, we shall have a still
more difficult task to re-establish order and a quiet and regular government in
the country, and this difficulty promises to be enormously increased by all that
is passing here on the subject. Shaftesbury is stirring up all the fanaticism of
the country, and clamouring for what he calls the <i>emancipation</i> of Christianity
in India, and even the 'Times,' once celebrated for its strong sound sense and
its fearless independence, is afraid to rebuke this nonsense, and endorses it by
saying 'we have commited great errors,' but without explaining what it means, or
giving any exemplification of the assertion. The real meaning, however, of the
Exeter Hall clamour is, that we should commence as soon as we can a crusade
against the religions of the natives of India, and attempt to force Christianity
upon them. I begin to have the most dismal forebodings upon this Indian
question. I continue indeed to believe that by dint of enormous exertions, by a
vast expenditure of money, and sending out every man we can raise and make a
soldier of, we shall sooner or later conquer the mutineers and suppress the
rebellion, but I expect we shall lose our Indian Empire. I may possibly not live
to see the catastrophe, but those who are twenty or may be ten years younger
than I am in all probability will. All our legislation is conducting us to this
end. We are taking this moment of war and confusion to revolutionize our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> Indian
Empire and government, to root up all that the natives have been accustomed to
regard with veneration, and to pronounce sentence of condemnation upon the only
authority of which they know anything, and which has been the object of their
fears and hopes, and sometimes of their attachment. The Government is about to
hurry into this measure as if the existing system had been the cause of the
present rebellion and conflict, and that the one they propose to substitute
would be so much better and capable of repairing the mischief which the
government of the Company has caused by its alleged mismanagement. I have no
prejudice or partiality for the Company, but I believe any great change at this
moment to be fraught with danger, and that the notion of improving the state of
affairs by the abolition of what is called the double government is a mere
delusion.<a name="FNanchor_1_25" id="FNanchor_1_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_25" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_25" id="Footnote_1_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_25"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [The experience of nearly thirty years has proved that these gloomy
forebodings were unfounded. The Government and the condition of the Indian
Empire have undergone enormous changes in that interval of time, but upon the
whole the suppression of the military revolt of 1857 has placed British
authority in India upon a more secure basis, the loyalty of the native princes
to the Crown has increased, the native population is more enlightened and more
prosperous, and the dangers which may still threaten the British Empire in India
are not those which struck the mind of Mr. Greville in 1858. He himself,
however, soon changed his opinion. See entry of the 12th March, <i>infra.</i>]</p></div>


<p><i>January 16th.</i>&mdash;I went to The Grange on Tuesday and returned yesterday morning,
when I was met by the news of an attempted assassination of the Emperor
Napoleon, whose escape seems to have been providential.</p>

<p>It is since I last wrote anything here that we have received the news from India
of Wyndham's defeat at Cawnpore, and of Sir Colin's subsequent victory, but we
are not yet informed of the details so as to be able to pass a judgement on
these events, and upon Wyndham's conduct. It may be doubted, however, whether
the small defeat in the one case is not more prejudicial than the considerable
victory in the other is advantageous; and the inference to be derived from the
whole is to my mind of a gloomy character, for I think unless we can manage to
pour into India an unceasing stream of fresh troops for an indefinite period,
we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> shall succumb in the contest by the mere weight of numbers, and the question
is, whether we shall be able to do this, which seems to me exceedingly doubtful.
The Government appear never to have been sufficiently alive to the danger and
the difficulties of this warfare, and have contented themselves with going on
leisurely and lazily, preparing reinforcements to be sent out from time to time,
but have never thought it incumbent on them to make the extraordinary efforts
that the case imperatively demands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD JOHN RUSSELL IN OPPOSITION.</div>

<p>When Parliament meets I shall be surprised if there is not before long a great
storm in both Houses, and if Palmerston means to rest upon his popularity, and
to endeavour to conjure it by his habitual offhand manner and assurances that
they have done all they could, expecting that such assurances will be accepted
as a matter of course, I think he will be greatly mistaken. In spite of all that
has been said to John Russell, and his not unfriendly disposition during the
short autumnal session, his patience and prudence are evidently well-nigh
exhausted, and we may soon expect to see him in vehement opposition. He writes
to his brother that 'he is appalled at the part he may be obliged to take in the
coming session,' and he seems to be under the influence of a fresh feeling of
antipathy to Palmerston. It is not unlikely that he thinks it not worth his
while to wait for the chance of Palmerston's being withdrawn from the field, and
that he may as well gratify his inclination by going into Opposition, and it is
likely enough that he fancies he has more influence in the House of Commons and
the country than he really possesses, and may collect a party of his own,
instead of being grudgingly accepted by the present Government as a matter of
necessity, rather than one of choice. If this is his view, I believe he is
egregiously mistaken. Lowe, whom I met at The Grange, and who knows something of
both Parliamentary and public opinion, told me that John Russell would find no
support in the House of Commons where his influence was extinct, and that so far
from forming a party of his own, he did not believe if Palmerston were to die
to-morrow, and Lord John take his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> place at the head of the Government, that the
Government itself would stand.</p>


<p><i>Woburn Abbey, January 19th.</i>&mdash;Yesterday morning we were astounded by the
receipt of a telegraphic message informing Granville that the Duke of Devonshire
had been found dead in his bed.<a name="FNanchor_1_26" id="FNanchor_1_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_26" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Nothing could be more sudden and unexpected,
and the immediate cause of his death is not known. At different periods of my
life I have lived in great intimacy with him, but he was capricious, so the
intervals, were long and frequent during which we were almost strangers to each
other. Spoiled by his mother as a boy, and becoming Duke of Devonshire with a
colossal fortune at twenty-one years old, and besides afflicted with incurable
deafness, his existence was <i>manquï¿½</i>, and he was a disappointed and unhappy man.
His abilities were of a very high order, and if he had not been relieved by his
position and wealth from the necessity of exertion and disqualified by his
infirmities from taking an active part in public life, he might have been a
considerable and important as well as a far happier man; but as he had
unfortunately no positive tastes or active pursuits, no domestic ties to engage
his affections, and no public duties to occupy his mind, he was reduced to fill
up the vacuum of his existence by capricious <i>engouements</i> and frivolous
society. He was very clever and very comical, with a keen sense of humour,
frequently very droll with his intimate friends, and his letters were always
very amusing. The Duke lived very much like a grand seigneur, hospitable and
magnificent; he was very fond of his family, and very kind to them, as he was
also to those of his friends whom he took into favour, many of the poorer of
whom will have great reason to regret the loss of a benefactor. There was for a
long time a vague notion that some mystery attached to his birth, and that he
was not really the son, or at all events not the legitimate son, of his reputed
father. The idea was that Lady Elizabeth Foster (whom the Duke afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
married as his second wife) and the Duchess had been confined at the same time
at Paris, and that the latter having a girl and the former a boy, the children
had been changed, the Duke being the father of both children. I always treated
this story as a myth, and this opinion has been confirmed by the deposition of
the woman who had received the child in her arms upon his birth, which was
conclusive evidence of his legitimacy. It is remarkable that the whole of the
vast property of the late Duke was in his own power. The entail was cut off upon
his majority, and his father died before the estates were resettled.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_26" id="Footnote_1_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_26"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [William Spencer, sixth Duke of Devonshire, born May 21, 1790, died
January 17, 1858. He was Mr. Greville's second cousin, the Duchess of Portland,
mother of Lady Charlotte Greville, having been the daughter of the fourth Duke
of Devonshire.]</p></div>


<p><i>January 20th.</i>&mdash;The more I hear from India and about Indian affairs, and the
more I read and reflect upon the subject, the more desponding I become as to our
future prospects there; first, as to our means of bringing the war to a
successful issue, and secondly, as to our power to govern the country and keep
it quiet and contented when the first object has been accomplished.</p>


<div class="sidenote">DISRAELI'S OVERTURE TO THE WHIGS.</div>

<p><i>January 23rd.</i>&mdash;On arriving in town yesterday, I received a visit from
Disraeli, who said he had come to consult me <i>in confidence</i>, and to ask my
opinion, by which his own course would be very much influenced. I was not a
little surprised at this exordium, but told him I should be glad to hear what
his object was, and that he was welcome to any opinion he wished for from me. He
then began a rather hazy discourse, from which I gathered, or at least thought I
gathered, that he thinks the present state of affairs very serious, and the
position of the Government very precarious; that he is meditating on the
possible chances there may be for him and his party in the event of Palmerston's
fall, and knowing that some sort of coalition with some other party would be
indispensable to form any other Government, an idea had crossed his mind that
this might be practicable with some of the most moderate of the Whigs,
especially with the younger ones, such as Granville and Argyll, and he wished to
know if I thought this would be possible, and whether I could be in any way
instrumental in promoting it, and if I did not think so what my ideas were as to
the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> advisable course in order to avert the threatened Reform, and to give
the country a better Government than this. This, with a great deal of verbiage
and mixed with digressions about the leading men of the present day, seemed to
me to be the substance and object of his talk. He professed to speak to me of
his own sentiments without disguise, and with entire confidence about
everything, but I cannot call to mind that he imparted to me anything of the
slightest interest or importance. It would be difficult and not very interesting
to write down our somewhat vague and <i>dï¿½cousu</i> conversation, but I told him that
I knew very little of the dispositions of any of the men he alluded to, but I
did not believe they any of them would be parties to any such combination as he
looked to, or separate from their present colleagues.</p>


<p><i>January 25th.</i>&mdash;We are still without any advices from India. The petition to
Parliament of the East India Company, which is very able, and was written by
John Mill, has produced a considerable effect in the world, and doubts are
expressed in all quarters whether Government will be able to carry their Bill.</p>


<p><i>January 26th.</i>&mdash;The Princess Royal's wedding went off yesterday with amazing
<i>ï¿½clat</i>, and it is rather ludicrous to contrast the vehement articles with which
the Press teemed (the 'Times' in particular) against the alliance two years ago
with the popularity of it and the enthusiasm displayed now. The whole thing
seems to have been very successful. At the breakfast after the wedding, to which
none but the Royalties were invited, the French Princes were present, which was
amiable and becoming on the part of the Queen.</p>


<p><i>January 28th.</i>&mdash;As the day approaches for the re-assembling of Parliament there
is an increasing impression that this Government is very likely not to get
through the session, and the 'Times,' which is always ready to assist in the
discomfiture of a losing party, is now showing unmistakeable symptoms of its own
doubts whether the Government is any longer worth supporting, and Delane told me
yesterday he thought they would not remain long in office, and that it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> time
they should go, and he ridiculed the idea of its not being practicable to form
another Government. It is absurd, but nevertheless true, that nothing has
damaged Palmerston so much as his making Clanricarde Privy Seal. It was an
unwise appointment, but the fault of it is grossly exaggerated. Everybody agrees
that from one end of the country to another there is a feeling of universal
indignation against it. Then there is a great turn in the public mind in favour
of the East India Company, or rather against the Government measure, of which
nothing is known, but that the result of it will be to place the Indian Empire
in the hands of Vernon Smith.</p>


<div class="sidenote">EFFECTS OF THE ORSINI CONSPIRACY.</div>

<p><i>February 2nd.</i>&mdash;The Indian question has for the moment been superseded by the
French question as it may be called, that is, by the storm which is raging in
France against this country, its institutions and laws, in reference to the
assassination plot of January 14.<a name="FNanchor_1_27" id="FNanchor_1_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_27" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It was well known that the French
Government had been urging our Ministers to adopt measures or to pass laws
against the refugees and their machinations in this country; but while this
question was under discussion, we were astounded by a speech made by Persigny in
reply to an address from the City, and still more by the publication in the
'Moniteur' of certain addresses from corps or regiments of the French army to
the Emperor, full of insult and menace to this country. These offensive
manifestations naturally excited great indignation here, and the Press did not
fail to hurl back these insults, and to retort with interest upon the persons
from whom they had proceeded or who had permitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> their appearance. On Sunday I
spoke to Clarendon on the subject. He is very much annoyed and embarrassed by
this posture of affairs as might be expected, but more than this he is very much
alarmed, more than I think he need be. I said it seemed to be that the Emperor
had forgotten his usual good sense, and that he who knows this country ought to
have felt that if he wishes to have anything done here, he is taking the most
effectual means to prevent it by permitting the military addresses to appear in
the 'Moniteur,' since in the present state of the Press this is tantamount to
their being published by the Government itself. I said I could not believe that
these hot and enthusiastic expressions were to be taken entirely as proofs of a
passionate attachment to the Emperor's person, but that these were outbreaks of
that hatred of England which sometimes slumbered, but never died. He said the
Emperor felt that his alliance with this country was indispensable to him, and
regretted sincerely the displays of feeling in France, but that he did not dare
to repress the sentiments evinced by the army, though he kept them in check as
well as he could, and the truth was, as I have said above, that it was the
undying animosity to us which had found a vent upon this occasion. He added that
he had not blamed Morny, who could not say less than he did without being
denounced by the Chamber as an inadequate exponent of its sentiments. The
French, seeing how all our force is absorbed in our Indian war, think they may
treat us as they please, and Clarendon fancies that if any accident were to
befall the Emperor, any Government that might be able to establish itself would
go to war with us as the best means of ingratiating itself with the nation and
of being able to establish itself. He says they can march 50,000 men at a
moment's notice to Cherbourg, where there is an abundance of war steamers ready
to transport them across the Channel, while we have no soldiers and no ships to
defend us in case of such a storm suddenly bursting. George Lewis says that
Clarendon is haunted with this apprehension, which he does not share in the
slightest degree.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_27" id="Footnote_1_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_27"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [It was known in France that the explosive bombs with which Orsini
had attempted the life of the Emperor Napoleon were manufactured in England, and
that some of the accomplices of that conspirator were still in this country,
where the law could not reach them for a crime committed abroad. These facts
called forth a strong hostile feeling, and England was accused of harbouring
assassins. On January 20 Count Walewski addressed a remonstrance to the British
Government, which remained unanswered, and on January 23 Count Persigny spoke in
strong language to a deputation from the City of London. Military addresses of a
violent character from several French regiments to the Emperor were published in
the <i>Moniteur</i>. On February 9 Lord Palmerston introduced a bill, called The
Conspiracy to Murder Bill, making conspiracy to murder a felony. The opposition
to this bill gave rise to the ensuing events and overthrew the Ministry.]</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>Though there is some truth in this account of the Emperor's position, I cannot
believe that he might not have kept matters more quiet in France than he has
done, if he had exerted his influence and power for that end. There can be no
doubt that our international relations are upon a very unpleasant and perilous
footing, and that the evil is not corrected by the fact of the two Courts being
on friendly terms, by mutual interchanges of soft sawder and proofs of
friendship in the shape of handsome bridal gifts from the Emperor and Empress to
the Princess Royal. We are going to do something to soothe the French; but as it
will, I believe, be no more than to make that a felony which is now only a
misdemeanour, it may be doubted if this will satisfy or appease them; but it
would be impossible to do more even if it were desirable, which I think it is
not, and I doubt if even this slight concession will be obtained from Parliament
without some strong and indignant remarks upon the tone which has been adopted
towards England.</p>


<div class="sidenote">PETITION OF THE EAST INDIA COMPANY.</div>

<p><i>February 3rd.</i>&mdash;The Directors have got Tom Baring and Lord Grey to present
their petition in the two Houses, and they mean to adopt the moderate and
judicious course of not agitating any further, but trust to the course of
events, which is now turning in their favour, and to ask for delay and a
Committee. Graham, acting, I believe, independently, means to move for a
Committee. John Russell intimated to him that he did not think he should support
such a motion, but he has not finally determined what to do, and I rather expect
he will end in voting for it. Palmerston's friends still tell him that his name
is all powerful, and that he is sure of carrying through the House of Commons
whatever he proposes, if the House thinks there is any possibility of a defeat
leading to his resignation, and such is evidently his own opinion. In a
Committee on Indian affairs and the intended bill, at which Bethell was present,
on some objection or possible objection being suggested by one of the members,
Palmerston said in his usual jaunty way, 'Oh, they will fall in love with our
bill when they see it;' when Bethell, in his niminy-piminy manner and simper,
said,'Oh, my dear Lord!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> Granville, who told me, says it was very funny. They
all seem conscious of the diminution of Palmerston's energy and power. He is
always asleep, both in the Cabinet and in the House of Commons, where he
endeavours to conceal it by wearing his hat over his eyes. Clarendon made me
laugh heartily the other day at his account of the Cabinet, where one half of
them seem to be almost always asleep, the first to be off being Lansdowne,
closely followed by Palmerston and Charles Wood. I remember his giving me a very
droll account of Melbourne's Cabinet, and of the drowsiness which used to reign
there, more particularly with Melbourne himself.</p>


<p><i>February 11th.</i>&mdash;I never remember Parliament meeting with much greater
curiosity and excitement. The situation of the Government is generally regarded
as so precarious, and the revolution in Palmerston's popularity and therefore
his power is so extraordinary, that everybody is expecting some great events
will occur, and the hopes of all who wish for a change and who expect to profit
by it are reviving. The bill brought in by Palmerston on Tuesday for the purpose
of punishing conspirators and with a view to satisfy the exigency of the French
Government made a great stir. The leave to bring it in was carried by a large
majority, thanks to the Conservatives, but its success was principally owing to
the Emperor's apology arriving just before the debate began. This pacified most
of those who were enraged at the publications in the 'Moniteur,' and disposed to
oppose the measure on account of the conduct of the French Government. I have no
sympathy with such a feeling, but it is well calculated to go down with the
public, and to afford a plausible pretext to the Ultra-Liberals and the
crotchety politicians. The greatest objection to this bill is that it will
probably be quite useless for its alleged object, and though perhaps something
more stringent might be useful, the Government do not dare propose anything
beyond the present measure.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most serious reflexion to which this matter gives rise is the
suspicion that the conduct of the Emperor Napoleon betrays either some strange
infirmity in his facul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>ties, or something so unsound and dangerous in the state
of France, as to be pregnant with possible consequences it is frightful to
contemplate. All that he has been doing, or has allowed to be done of late, is
indicative of a change; for the moderation and prudence, together with firmness
and decision, which have hitherto formed his best claim to the admiration and
approbation of this country seem to have completely deserted him. The penal laws
enacted or to be enacted in France are considered as the inauguration of a reign
of terror, and there is rapidly growing up the same sort of feeling about the
French Empire that there is here about the Palmerston Government. Nobody
pretends to foresee what will happen, but everyone thinks that the state of
France is rendered more combustible, and that any spark may produce an
explosion. Those who are most attached or most favourable to the Imperial
Government are the most alarmed, and, when they dare speak out, express the
greatest regret and alarm at all that is passing in France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PERILS OF THE GOVERNMENT.</div>

<p>To turn to the Government here, their two great rocks ahead are the India Bill
and the Reform Bill, but with regard to these there seems no knowledge how
parties will act, and how leading individuals will vote. Most people, however,
are impressed with the idea that neither measure will be carried, and that the
Government will in all probability not get through the session. It will be too
absurd if Palmerston, after being the idol of the public, in spite of or in
consequence of all his foolish speeches and his outrageous acts, should find
himself deserted and his power shaken because he made Clanricarde Privy Seal;
but there can be no doubt that this appointment has had more effect than any
other cause in the change of public opinion about him.</p>


<p><i>February 14th.</i>&mdash;Last week saw the debates in the House of Commons about the
Conspiracy Bill, and the first act of the India Bill. The first is very
unpopular, but it will be carried nevertheless. John Russell has taken it up
with extraordinary vehemence and anger. His opposition to it is furious, on high
constitutional grounds, which appear to me absurd and uncalled for. If I were in
Parliament I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> be puzzled how to vote, for there is much to be said
against the Bill, and much against voting against it, particularly against leave
to bring it in. Almost all the Tories voted with Government, and John Russell
carried very few with him, and neither of his own nephews. He is more than ever
exasperated against Palmerston for bringing it in. The apology tended by the
Emperor, which was read to the House, reconciled a great many to the bill, but I
have no notion that it will do any good, or that the French Government will be
satisfied with it. After such a bill, which will certainly be carried, the
British Lion must put his tail between his legs, and 'Civis Romanus' give up
swaggering so loftily. If Aberdeen had attempted such a measure when Louis
Philippe was King and Guizot minister, what would Palmerston have said, and what
would not have been the indignant outcry throughout the country? The balance of
opinion now seems to be that Government will carry their India Bill, and the
report is that they are willing, if the second reading is carried, to consent to
any alterations that may be pressed upon them in Committee. Lewis seems to have
made a good speech on Friday, though rather of a didactic character.</p>


<div class="sidenote">A CRITICAL SITUATION.</div>

<p><i>February 20th.</i><a name="FNanchor_1_28" id="FNanchor_1_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_28" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;Unless I were to write down day by day the events and the
<i>impressions</i> of each day I should fail in giving anything like a picture of the
time, and I regret that my indolence or other occupations have prevented my
doing this. I have each day promised myself I would not neglect it, and then,
failing to keep that promise (to myself), I have found some fresh occurrence
sweeping away the interest, and generally the accurate recollection, of what the
preceding days have produced. The varieties of the aspects of public affairs
have been like the figures in a kaleidoscope, and one ought to catch each
fleeting sym<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>metrical arrangement before it is changed into some other equally
fleeting in order to comprehend the rapidity and importance of the changes which
are going on. Not long ago (that is, not many weeks) a vague idea began to
circulate that the Government would have difficulty in getting successfully
through this session, and that their power had suffered some diminution. It was
thought that the India Bill and the Reform Bill would be too much for them, and
when a little later the events in France induced them to bring in the Conspiracy
Bill, the excessive unpopularity of this last measure strengthened the
impression of their instability. Everybody out of the pale of the Government
itself admitted that Palmerston was not the man he was, and the diminution of
his popularity was visible universally. This was attributed to several smaller
causes, but the great one was the appointment of Clanricarde; which beyond all
doubt has been regarded with a disgust and indignation to the last degree
exaggerated and uncalled for. Such was the state of public feeling and opinion
when the Parliamentary campaign opened with the discussions first of the
Conspiracy Bill, and secondly of the Reform Bill. After a few days, however, a
great change seemed to have taken place, though the country and the Press
watched with great jealousy the progress of the Conspiracy Bill, keeping up a
very loud growl of dislike to the Bill, and resentment against the French
Government. In the division on the question of leave to bring in the bill the
majority of the Conservatives came over to the Government, and they got a
majority of the Conservatives of three to one. A few days after Palmerston
brought in the India Bill, about which for a moment it was thought Baring with
his amendment might run him hard, but after a very poor debate, in which the
Chancellor of the Exchequer made a very good speech, and the President of the
Board of Control made no speech at all, the Government got a majority of near
150. These two victories, though the first was obtained by the aid of opponents,
raised the spirits of the Ministerialists, and were generally taken as
indicative of more strength than they had been supposed to have, and as pretty
clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> proofs that Palmerston would at all events get unscathed through this
session with not much diminished authority and influence.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_28" id="Footnote_1_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_28"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [On February 19 the Government were defeated on the Conspiracy Bill,
in the House of Commons, by a majority of 234 to 215, Mr. Milner Gibson's
amendment having been carried against them. The majority consisted of 146
Conservatives, 84 Liberals. Mr. Gladstone, Lord John Russell, Sir James Graham,
Mr. Cardwell, and Mr. Sidney Herbert voted against the Bill. Lord Palmerston
immediately resigned.]</p></div>

<p>But while they were triumphing in the fancied security which these divisions
seemed to promise them, a storm was gathering, for the bursting of which, they
were far from being prepared, nor did they estimate its importance. The public
feeling had become more and more exasperated at the Conspiracy Bill, and at the
conduct of France. The first reading of the bill would not have been carried as
it was, perhaps not at all, but for the <i>apology</i>, as it was called, of the
Emperor, and the soothing effect of Walewski's despatch carrying expressions of
his master's regret and a sort of half disclaimer of the military addresses. But
this soothing effect was very transitory. It was remarked that while the
'Moniteur' continued to insert fresh addresses of an offensive character, the
apologetic despatch did not appear at all, and the original despatch of Walewski
(January 20), which had excited so much indignation here, and which was not
denied to have been the origin of the Conspiracy Bill, lay upon the table of the
House of Commons unanswered by our Government. On this point a good deal of
surprise and anger had been evinced in the Press and in society, and the
discontent against the Government generally, and Palmerston in particular, was
still spreading, when Milner Gibson took advantage of the prevailing temper, and
moved a resolution in the shape of an amendment to the second reading of the
bill, very skilfully concocted, but which was a direct vote of censure upon the
Government (particularly of course directed against Palmerston and Clarendon)
for not having answered that despatch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEFEAT OF THE GOVERNMENT.</div>

<p>Palmerston, I have been assured, when he saw the terms of this amendment,
perceived that it might be dangerous, and that it was well calculated to get
votes; but it is certain that the Government generally were in no apprehension,
and that nobody of any party (I believe literally nobody) had the least idea
that any vote of censure, which of course involved the existence of the
Government, had the slightest chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> of being carried. I met Sir Edward Lytton
at the Athenï¿½um on Friday, just as he was going to the House, and had some
conversation with him. He treated Palmerston's position as impregnable, and said
he would have a very large majority that evening. So confident were the
Government whippers in that they made no exertions, and Hayter actually allowed
some of his people to go away unpaired, telling them that they were quite safe,
and their presence not necessary. I went to the House of Lords that evening to
hear Macaulay, who was to have spoken but did not speak, and afterwards went
home, hearing nothing more that night. Great was my astonishment when I read in
the 'Times' this morning that Government had been beaten on Milner Gibson's
motion by 19, and a few minutes after Granville came in and said that this
defeat must be conclusive and nothing left for them but to resign. A Cabinet was
held in the afternoon, at which it was decided that Palmerston should repair to
Buckingham Palace with the resignations of himself and his colleagues.</p>


<p><i>February 21st.</i>&mdash;Nothing more was known last night, but it was evident that
Derby had been sent for in preference to Lord John, whom I met at Brooks's in
the morning, and who did not expect the Queen to send for him. He told me
Gladstone, he believed, and Graham, he knew, would not join Derby, and he
thought neither Sidney Herbert nor Cardwell would either. As to the future,
there really are <i>quot homines tot sententiï¿½</i>. Some think Derby cannot form a
Government, some that he will not try. The sanguine Palmerstonians think all
other attempts will fail and Palmerston remain in power, as Lord Grey did in
1831, and some fancy he will endeavour to propitiate the House of Commons and
public opinion by throwing overboard Clanricarde, to whose appointment the
mischief is in great measure attributed. Such is at this moment the state of
doubt and confusion which generally prevail.</p>


<p><i>February 23rd.</i>&mdash;Nothing is yet known of Derby's progress except that he tried
the Peelites, not one of whom would join. He sent for Newcastle from Clumber,
who came up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> saw him, and declined. It is evident that they mean to act in
concert, except probably Graham, who has espoused John Russell, and who will not
separate himself from Lord John's fortunes. There was a prevailing expectation
yesterday that Derby would abandon his attempt, and that Palmerston would come
back, but Derby seems quite determined to go on. The Palmerstonians certainly
expect their exclusion to be of short duration, and nobody thinks that any
Government Derby can possibly make will last long.</p>

<p>Never was there a great catastrophe so totally unexpected. Within an hour of the
beginning of the debate no one doubted that the Government would have a
majority, but Milner Gibson's speech was not concluded before it was evident
that his amendment would be carried, and Palmerston's conduct was very
unaccountable. It was clear from the tone of his speech, which was as bad as
possible, feeble and intemperate, that he was aware of what was going to happen,
and yet when the true state of the case was urged upon him, and he was pressed
to adjourn the debate till Monday, which could easily have been done, he
obstinately refused. If he had done this, there is little doubt that he would
have whipped up a majority by Monday. Certainly no people ever so mismanaged
their affairs. There is no excuse for their having put on the table of the House
of Commons such a despatch as Walewski's, without any reply being made to it. It
required no great sagacity to anticipate that such a course of proceeding could
not fail to throw the House of Commons into a flame, and exasperate the country,
already much excited, and all the excuses they made only made their case worse,
and were generally inconsistent with each other. George Grey's was the most
pitiful, when he said that after the second reading an answer should be sent.
Then they made shuffling statements: at one time that they had sent no answer,
and that to have answered it as alone it could be answered must have increased
the irritation. Then, that they had given a verbal answer, and at last it
transpired that an answer had been sent in the shape of a <i>private</i> letter from
Clarendon to Cowley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">MISMANAGEMENT.</div>

<p>There were two courses open to the Government, either of which might have been
very naturally and not improperly taken. Palmerston might have announced that it
was not his intention to produce any of the correspondence between the two
Governments, and asked the House of Commons to place confidence in him, and
allow him to take the steps he deemed best to satisfy the French Government, and
at the same time vindicate the honour and dignity of this country, and if he had
stated that he thought it would be injurious to the interests of peace and amity
to produce any papers, it is perfectly certain he would have met with unanimous
acquiescence. The only objection I have heard to this is that the French
Government published the despatch in the 'Moniteur;' but if Palmerston had
resolved upon silence here, he could have informed Cowley of his resolution, and
instructed him to come to a common agreement with Walewski that they should
publish nothing in the 'Moniteur,' and we should keep the correspondence from
Parliament here. Not acting in this way, he ought to have sent an answer, and
who can suppose that such men as Palmerston and Clarendon, whose lives have been
passed in writing despatches, and who are both so remarkably expert at that
work, should be unable to concoct a reply to Walewski which should be
conciliatory in tone and matter, and at once suffice for the fears and
exigencies of France and for the national pride and honour of England?
Clarendon's private letter is said to have been excellent, and of course it must
have been well adapted for its purposes. What difficulty could there have been,
therefore, in converting the private into a public letter, which if it had
accompanied the French letter would have pacified both the House of Commons and
the country, for the Government ought not to have forgotten, as it seems they
did, that the English and French Governments were not the only parties in this
transaction, but there were the English Government and the House of Commons and
the country, between whom accounts had to be settled. There are people who fancy
that Palmerston was not sorry to be beaten on Milner Gibson's motion, thinking
it better to go out upon that than upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> the motion against Clanricarde on March
4 (the abolition of the Privy Seal), on which they think they certainly would
have been defeated, and on which they must have resigned; but I don't think
their defeat on the latter was so certain, and they might have been saved by
Clanricarde's resignation before the debate came on. The conduct of those who
brought forward and those who supported the vote of censure, and that of the
Government in going out upon it, admits of much diversity of opinion. The
friends of the Government, and those who were averse to a change, maintain that
the amendment was inexcusable, and that the House of Commons had no business to
meddle with the functions of the Executive, or to express any opinion as to the
propriety of answering or not a despatch which ought to have been left to the
discretion of the Minister, and the ex-Ministers say that the vote made it
impossible for them to do anything but resign, and that their opponents must
have been fully aware that this would be the consequence of their victory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DETERMINATION TO RESIGN.</div>

<p>Their conduct is inexplicable to me, for I believe they were very sorry to go
out, and yet if they had wished it they might have very well stayed in.
According to ancient practice any vote of censure produced resignation as a
matter of course, no matter what the subject of it, but it did so because a vote
of censure, and indeed any adverse vote on any important measure, implied that
the House of Commons had withdrawn its confidence from the Government, the fact
of which rendered it impossible for them to carry on the affairs of the country,
and obliged them to resign. But it is impossible to pretend that the late vote
indicated the withdrawal of the confidence of the House of Commons generally.
They had had two immense majorities a few days before, and they would have had
another as large a few days after if they had gone on with the bill. If I had
been able to advise the Queen, I would have recommended her to refuse Lord
Palmerston's resignation, and have insisted on his testing the question of
confidence on the Conspiracy Bill, or on some question in which the national
passions were not concerned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> and he could not have refused to take this course.
Even after she had sent for Derby he gave her the opportunity (though not I
suppose the advice to do so), for he said she had better take another day for
consideration, and then if she decided on wishing him to form a Government, he
would undertake it.</p>


<p><i>February 26th.</i>&mdash;I met George Lewis yesterday, and talked over with him the
whole affair. He thinks that it has all been fearfully mismanaged, and that the
catastrophe might have been avoided in many different ways: first, by answering
the despatch; secondly, by doing what I have suggested, producing no papers and
asking for confidence; then by the Speaker's declining to allow the amendment to
be put, as he well might have done, and as a <i>strong</i> Speaker would have done.
Lord Eversley advised him to do this, and gave his strong opinion that the
amendment was inadmissible. It is curious that Palmerston's overthrow should be
the work of a Parliament elected expressly to support him, and immediately
caused by the act of a Speaker whom he insisted upon putting in the chair,
contrary to the advice of many others who thought he would prove inefficient.</p>

<p>I told Lewis I thought their resignation was not called for, and what I would
have advised the Queen. He said the whole question was well and most calmly and
dispassionately considered, and they were unanimous as to the necessity of
resignation, with the sole exception of Vernon Smith, and that was without any
<i>arriï¿½re pensï¿½e</i> of returning on an anticipated failure of Derby; that the Queen
had begged Palmerston not to resign upon this vote, and he had returned to the
Cabinet, and reported what she said, but they were all without exception for
adhering to their resignation. Derby, too, had evidently wished to afford
Palmerston an opportunity of recalling it, for he had begged the Queen to take
twenty-four hours to consider of it; but it is probable that Her Majesty, having
failed to persuade Palmerston in the first instance, had thought it useless to
make any further attempts.</p>

<p>Lewis gave me such strong reasons for their determination,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span> that I confess they
materially shook my opinion. He said there was no possibility of mistaking the
feeling there was against Palmerston, which if I had been present and seen what
passed in the House that night, I could not have doubted; that the only way in
which they could have stayed in was by getting somebody to move a vote of
confidence, which was too dangerous an experiment, as in the present state of
the House of Commons it was at least an even chance that such a vote would not
have been carried, and certain that they would have had all the great guns of
all sides thundering against them. He thought Palmerston's speech had been very
ill advised, and had done much harm, and that it was a mistake not to have
adjourned the debate, when it was very probable that they might have had an
opportunity of changing the fortune of it.</p>

<p><i>London, 27th February.</i>1858.&mdash;All yesterday lists of the new appointments were
put forth from hour to hour, unlike each other, and proving what changes had
been made during the last hours. Nobody was prepared for Bulwer Lytton having no
place, and still less for Lord Stanley taking office in this Government, which
must have been settled at the eleventh hour. On the whole it presents a more
decent-looking affair than anybody expected, but the general impression is that
it cannot last, and must be overthrown by the mere weight of numbers, whenever
the different sections of the House should unite on any question whatever.

<div class="sidenote">LORD DERBY'S ADMINISTRATION.</div>

<p><i>March 2nd.</i>&mdash;Last night Derby made his statement. He was very nervous and
unlike himself, scarcely audible at first, much less fluent than usual, and he
spoke from notes, which I never saw him do before. It was, however, a very
judicious and becoming speech. Granville and Clarendon both spoke very well, and
the whole affair was very creditable and satisfactory, civil, courteous, and
good-humoured on all sides. Clarendon made a very plausible defence of his own
conduct in not answering Walewski's despatch, which was so good that Hardwicke
crossed the House to compliment him, and said if that speech had been made in
the House of Commons there would have been no division. The impression left on
me is that though it was a pretty good defence, he would have exercised a
sounder discretion if he had sent an answer, and that there was no difficulty in
doing so. Clanricarde has given notice of what the 'Times' calls favouring the
House with some leaves of his autobiography. He has been advised to take this
course by some of his friends and colleagues, particularly Lord Lansdowne; but
in spite of such respectable authority, I think it an ill-advised step, from
which he is likely to derive little if any benefit. He is going to defend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
himself against something intangible, for no accuser will appear, and there is
no charge which he is called upon to rebut. No doubt his appointment has been
the real cause of the downfall of the Government. It is this which ruined the
popularity of Palmerston. It is only fair to admit that they could not have been
expected to anticipate all the hubbub it made, nor anything like it.</p>

<p>People are now wondering that Palmerston's fall has made so little sensation and
the event fallen so flat, considering what his popularity was only a few months
ago, but this proves what an unsubstantial and factitious popularity it was.
Derby has done better than his predecessor in one way, for he has brought
forward some new men who have a good reputation, and may distinguish themselves
in Parliament, and show us that we have something to look to beyond the old worn
out materials of which everybody is tired. The first class of this Government is
not worse than that of the last, and the second class is a great deal better.
There are some rather curious coincidences noticeable in this smash. The
majority by which the Whigs fell was nineteen. It was the same on the China
question last year, and nineteen turned out Derby in 1853. Derby has been three
times called on to form a Government, and each time on the 21st of February. At
the present moment there appears to be a disposition to give him what is called
a fair trial, but it is difficult to say how long this will last. The Whigs are
in great perplexity. Some talk of Palmerston coming back again, others want to
bring about a reunion between him and Lord John, and others still talk of
setting them both aside and electing a new leader of the party.</p>


<p><i>March 3rd.</i>&mdash;The discussion, for there was no debate, on Monday has produced a
very favourable effect. Derby's speech is much admired for its calm and
dignified tone, and the matter of it considered judicious and satisfactory. As
an exhibition the whole proceeding is thought eminently creditable to the
country, and such as must strike foreigners particularly. This is unquestionably
true, and it has been a very good start for Derby. As far as one can judge in
so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> short a time, there is a growing opinion that he ought to have fair play and
no vexatious opposition, and Granville this morning told me he thought he would
get on very well. Palmerston has begged Cowley not to resign, which is very
honourable and becoming. There are symptoms of a disposition on the part of the
'Times' to support the new Government and I have little doubt that they can
secure this great advantage if they manage their affairs with common prudence,
and set to work diligently to frame such measures of improvement and utility as
will satisfy public opinion. I entreated Jonathan Peel to lose no time in
dealing with the matter of the health of the soldiers and the mortality amongst
them brought to light by Sidney Herbert's Committee. This alone, well and
quickly done, would be of prodigious service to the new Government.</p>


<p><i>March 6th.</i>&mdash;I gather from what I hear that Lord Palmerston is preparing to
buckle on his armour, and to wage war against the new Government with the hope
and expectation of forcing himself back into office speedily, and that the new
Opposition mean to attack the new Government as quickly and as vehemently as
they can. John Russell says they 'ought not to be recklessly or prematurely
opposed.' Guizot it seems, has written to Aberdeen about the 'union of all
shades of Liberals' as a desideratum, to which Lord John says 'whether it be
possible he knows not, but that he is an obstacle to it on our side, and
Palmerston on the other.'</p>

<p>The Speaker, with whom I had a long talk yesterday, thinks this Government never
can stand, and he says, truly enough that though Derby and Co. did not <i>make</i>
the situation which compelled the resignation of the last, they <i>accepted</i> it
with full knowledge of the consequences of their vote, and are therefore
responsible. He considers that what has happened and is likely to happen is all
to the benefit of the Radicals, who well know this, and rejoice at it
accordingly and he thinks Milner Gibson framed his amendment with the design of
its leading to the defeat of Palmerston, and the advent of Derby to a power
which he never desired to be of long duration. All this I could not gainsay, and
it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> is certainly true that this change has only produced a fresh set of
difficulties and dangers, the result of which who can foresee?</p>

<p>Derby's liberal declaration in his programme last Monday has been taken up and
extended by his followers, but it is very improbable that the enunciation of
such principles and intentions will carry with it the assent of the old and
genuine Tories, many of whom will most likely ere long declare their adhesion to
their old creed, and their abhorrence of the new-born liberalism of their chief,
and Derby may one day find himself in a lesser degree in something like the
position of Peel when he gave notice of his intention to propose the Repeal of
the Corn Laws. Derby's declaration now affords a practical justification of
Peel's course then, for Peel was never so much opposed to Free Trade as Derby
and all his followers to Reform, and his excuse is based on similar grounds,
namely, the progress and irresistible force of public opinion.</p>


<div class="sidenote">A LITERARY DINNER PARTY.</div>

<p><i>March 10th.</i>&mdash;I dined with Grote yesterday to meet Mr. Buckle, the literary
lion of the day. He is not prepossessing in appearance, but he talks very well
and makes a great display of knowledge and extensive reading, though without
pedantry or dogmatism. There was a small party of literary men to meet him, and
Lady William Russell and I acted the part of gallery. The guests were Count
Platen the Swedish Minister, the Master of the Rolls, Dr. William Smith, young
Bunbury (Sir Henry's son), and Lowe. It was pleasant enough.</p>

<p>There is a prevailing and an increasing impression that this Government will not
last long, and I think its days are numbered. The old Government are evidently
impatient to resume their places, and within the last two or three days there is
an evident change in their spirits and their expectations. Whether it is
desirable or not that Derby should be permitted to go on for some time I know
not, but I doubt if it is possible. John Russell might perhaps prefer keeping
Derby in place for a time, in order to prevent Palmerston's coming back, but I
do not think he will be able to do so if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> wishes it, and even those Liberals
who are not very fond of Palmerston seem to be indignant at a Tory party holding
office with an immense majority against them in the House of Commons. It is
certainly a question whether any set of men have a right under any circumstances
to accept office with full knowledge that there is a majority of at least two to
one against them, and if one set of ministers are bound to resign, not merely on
finding the majority against them, but upon a single adverse vote, <i>ï¿½ fortiori</i>
must another set be precluded from taking office without the power of commanding
the assent and support of Parliament upon any question whatever. Sir Francis
Baring writes to John Russell, 'that the <i>existence</i> of the present Ministry is
contrary to Parliamentary Government,' and this seems to be the general
sentiment of the Liberal party, of course loudly insisted on by those who expect
to profit by ousting them.</p>


<p><i>March 11th.</i>&mdash;My mind fluctuates back to a notion that the Government will be
able to maintain themselves for some time. Ellice said yesterday that he for one
would not join in any attempt to oust them till he saw his way to the formation
of a better Government, and thinks time ought to be afforded for a reunion of
the Liberal party. In the afternoon I called on Disraeli, and found him rather
sanguine about their prospects. He said they should settle, in fact had settled,
the French question 'with flying colours.' He sees no difficulty about finance,
as there can be no quarrels on the score of principles, and he will only have to
provide for the expenses either by some increased taxation, or if that is
opposed, by a loan, and he does not think the Palmerstonians will venture to
refuse the supplies, or that they would succeed in such an attempt. His Indian
Bill he thinks will be a better and more popular measure, and he knows of
nothing else but the chapter of accidents on which they will have any serious
difficulty.</p>

<p>Afterwards I fell in with Charles Villiers, and talked over the fall of the
Government, which he attributed, as I do, to the enormous and inconceivable
blunders which his friends committed. He is always sensible, unprejudiced, and
the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> satisfactory person to talk to I am acquainted with. John Russell is
in great indignation at Disraeli's speech at his election, and his attributing
all sorts of bad motives to the Whigs in their Reform of 1831, which was
certainly very imprudent to say the least of it, for in his condition it was
most desirable for him to avoid giving offence to any of the influential people,
whose hostility may be very dangerous to him. I had not read his speech when I
saw him, or I should have told him so.</p>


<p><i>March 12th.</i>&mdash;It is remarkable how completely the affairs at home have
superseded the interest belonging to those of India. Nobody seems to think about
what so recently absorbed everyone's thoughts and feelings. This is, however, in
great measure owing to the general belief that the great question of suppressing
the rebellion and re-establishing our rule is virtually settled, and though we
may yet have a great deal of trouble and even difficulty, all serious danger is
at an end, and that we are as secure of possessing India as of any of our
colonies. The apprehensions I had on the subject, and which I have expressed,
have been very far from realized, and those who took more sanguine and confident
views of the issue of the contest have been justified by the event.</p>


<div class="sidenote">ATTACKS ON THE GOVERNMENT.</div>

<p><i>March 17th.</i>&mdash;The new Government is looking up. On Monday evening Bernal
Osborne attacked Disraeli in his usual style, and gave him an opportunity of
making a speech in reply, which everybody acknowledges to have been most able
and successful. Bernal was very bad, Palmerston spoke feebly, professed moderate
intentions towards the new Government, but clearly indicated that he meant to
take office again if he could. His speech was tamely received, and furnished a
fresh proof of the loss of his popularity and influence. Last night again, in a
little skirmish between Disraeli and George Lewis, the former had the best of
it. Clanricarde having had the egregious folly to announce to the House of Lords
his intention to make 'a personal statement,' in which he was unaccountably
supported by such men as George Lewis and Lansdowne amongst others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> found out
that everybody thought he was making a great fool of himself and withdrew it,
but his colleagues are annoyed at his putting himself forward to ask questions
of Derby. He sits on the front Opposition bench in the midst of his late
colleagues, who would be glad to be rid of him, particularly as they know that
in the event of their return to office he would be left out.</p>


<p><i>March 20th.</i>&mdash;I went on Friday with M. de Jarnac to Orleans House to pay a
visit to the Duc d'Aumale and see his interesting collection of books and
pictures. He is very courteous, obliging, and intelligent, and the Duchess very
civil and pleasing. His house was formerly occupied by his father, Louis
Philippe, improved and enlarged by Lord Kilmorey, who lived there with Miss
Hoste, and bought from him by the Duke, who has filled it full of objects of
historical or artistic interest, especially of memorials of the great Condï¿½. The
family portraits, of which there is a vast collection, are particularly curious.
He has two sons, who bear the fine titles of Prince de Condï¿½ and Duc de Guise,
but it is melancholy to contemplate the <i>avenir</i> of these boys, whose high birth
is their misfortune, and to whom no profession or occupation seems open. They
have lost their own country by no fault of their own, and are so situated that
they cannot or will not get adopted in any other.<a name="FNanchor_1_30" id="FNanchor_1_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_30" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It is a false position if
ever there was one. The family appear to have been alarmed by the recent events
in France, and the indirect effect which those events might have upon them, for
they have reason to believe that they are exposed to a constant system of
<i>espionnage</i> by the French Government, who wish very much to implicate them if
possible in some of the plots that they believe to be constantly going on here,
and great vigilance on their part is necessary not to commit themselves in any
way to unknown Frenchmen who approach under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> pretences of attachment to their
family or to make appeals to their charity.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_30" id="Footnote_1_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_30"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [Alas! both these interesting and promising young Princes were cut
off in early life, the Prince de Condï¿½ dying in New South Wales, at the outset
of a journey on which he had started under the most auspicious circumstances.
The Duc de Guise, then the sole surviving child and heir of the Duc d'Aumale,
also died soon after the return of the Royal Family to France in 1871.]</p></div>


<p>The other day I got a note from Lord Derby about a Council, at the end of which
he earnestly begged me if I had any influence with the 'Times' to get them to
abstain from writing any more irritating articles about France, for that these
articles provoked the French to madness, and, as matters are, that nothing but
the utmost care and moderation on both sides enabled the two Governments to go
on in harmony. I accordingly sent his note to Delane, who promised to attend to
it, though it was hard to leave the French press without replies. It is curious
that I should be found acting a friendly part towards Derby's Government, he
being of all men the one to whom I have felt the greatest political repugnance;
but I am now so free from all political predilections, and regard constant
changes as so objectionable, that I wish this Government to be fairly tried,
especially as it appears to me quite as good as any other we are likely to have;
disposed to work hard and promote good measures, and to be unable, even if they
were disposed, to do any harm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SETTLEMENT OF THE FRENCH QUARREL.</div>

<p>I find a disposition to carp at the settlement of the French quarrel, though
without any good reason. Lord Malmesbury's letter might have been better
composed, and more showy, but the object was to close the quarrel in a manner
that would satisfy the pride and allay the irritation of this country, without
being so exacting towards France as to pique her into fresh ebullitions
offensive to us, and this has been done, though it cannot be said with truth
that they had settled the dispute 'with flying colours.' The French Government
have had the last word, and exhibited some spleen, which is not very unnatural
considering the part they have had to play, eating humble pie and retracting
almost everything they said.</p>

<p>The Duke of Bedford is in town, having been urgently pressed to come up and see
what he could do to effect a political reconciliation between Lord John and
Palmerston, which he has certainly not effected, and probably will fail in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
effecting. Lord John said some months ago that he never would take office again
but as Premier, but what the Whigs want is that he should join them, consent to
co-operate in ousting Derby, and then to take office under Palmerston; but if he
would not do this before the present session began, much less would he be
inclined to do so now. He knows very well that they are only trying to make it
up with him, because they feel that they cannot do without him, and as they
still prefer Palmerston, and mean to stick to him, and to come back with him as
their chief, there is very little chance of any negotiation being brought to a
successful issue. The best chance of the Whigs being reunited is, that the
present Government should take sufficient root, and stay in office long enough
to show that nothing but a complete reconciliation of the Liberals of all shades
and opinions can drive them out, and for this time is required. The notion the
late Government cherished of being able to turn out their opponents in a very
brief space is already gone, and they find that the majority of the House of
Commons will be no party to such an overthrow.</p>

<p><i>March 21st.</i>&mdash;The Duke of Bedford has just been here; he has been occupied with
vain attempts to bring about the reconciliation so much desired by his political
friends, but without success or any hope of it; he finds the estrangement
between Palmerston and Lord John great as ever, and even between Lord John and
Clarendon, the latter complaining bitterly that Lord John 'went out of his way
to insult him,' which meant that in his speech the other day he spoke civilly of
Malmesbury, saying he had no doubt he would uphold the honour and dignity of the
country.' All this shows the excessive soreness and ill-humour of the outgoing
party, and though Clarendon expresses the most unalloyed satisfaction at being
out of office, it proves there is the <i>amari aliquid</i> to detract from his
pleasure at being free; and it is not unnatural that the great part he has
himself had in bringing about the catastrophe should make him very sore and
uneasy, and a blow has been given to his reputation the effects of which may be
hereafter serious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>


<p><i>March 25th.</i>&mdash;Marshal Pï¿½lissieris going to replace Persigny here as Ambassador,
a strange choice. He is a military ruffian, who knows no more of diplomacy than
he does of astronomy. Persigny goes because he cannot agree with Walewski; I
don't know the details of his dissatisfaction. His departure is regretted, as he
is believed to be honest and true, and sincerely anxious to promote a good
understanding between the two countries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RECONCILIATION OF STATESMEN.</div>

<p>The Duke of Bedford has just been here; he came from Lord Aberdeen, who tells
him the Peelites are all verging towards a union with Lord John, some more, some
less; Graham is devoted to him, Sidney Herbert and Cardwell perfectly well
disposed, the Duke of Newcastle gradually becoming so, and Gladstone at present
the least friendly, but Aberdeen thinks is getting more friendly, and will
eventually join his standard, and Aberdeen himself is doing all he can to bring
about this union. He is going to speak to the Queen about it, with a view of
reconciling her to Lord John without knowing how necessary it is. The Duke said
he rather doubted the expediency of Aberdeen's speaking to Her Majesty, but I
told him it was better he should, and very necessary to take all means to remove
her feeling against Lord John. I also told him what had passed between the Queen
and Clarendon, and how he had endeavoured to persuade Her Majesty that it would
be impossible for himself to be Prime Minister, and that if Palmerston failed
from any cause, her only course would be to send for Lord John, and to do so
frankly and graciously. I begged him to let Lord John know this, as it was so
desirable to bring about a reconciliation between them, which this fact would be
calculated to promote. The Duke owned it was very handsome conduct on the part
of Clarendon, as it is indeed on the part of Aberdeen, after all that Lord John
did in breaking up his Government; but Aberdeen is a gentleman and a patriot,
sincerely attached to the Queen, and to the best interests of the country, and
while he has retired altogether from public life and the turmoil of politics, he
is anxious still to exercise the great moral influence which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> he possesses to
advance the public interests according to the dictates of his judgement and his
conscience.</p>


<p><i>Hatchford, March 30th.</i>&mdash;On Friday last Disraeli brought on the Government
India Bill, which Ellenborough told some of his friends would be 'a great
success,' and which everybody expected would be an improvement on Palmerston's.
Never was there a greater failure; the bill was received with general aversion
and contempt. The Radicals, who want to keep the Government in for the present,
could not stomach it, Roebuck pronounced it a sham, and Bright, who detests
Palmerston, said he preferred his bill of the two. It is evidently impossible
that this bill can pass, and everybody sees what a fix it places public affairs
in, and what difficulties and uncertainties present themselves on all sides. The
only people who are pleased are the Palmerstonians. They think that when this
bill has been rejected or withdrawn theirs will pass, and this will, <i>ex
necessitate</i>, compel Derby to retire and open the way to Palmerston's return to
office. They are therefore chuckling over the dilemma, but it may be without its
leading to the realization of their hopes. There are a great many men in the
House of Commons, Peelites or Radicals principally, but also some others, who
cannot endure the notion of Palmerston's coming back, and who will oppose his
bill, after the other has been swept away, merely to prevent his return. What
the Radicals would like is that both bills should be referred to a Select
Committee, and a third bill be concocted out of the two; but this scheme would
not be likely to meet with general approbation, for it would be in fact a
delegation of the proper functions of government to the House of Commons. It
appears not unlikely that both bills will fail and that no measure at all will
pass this year. The Government people are extremely dejected at the state of
affairs, but it is said they do not mean to resign upon the defeat of their
bill.</p>

<p>Meanwhile John Russell has made a sort of overture to Granville, i.e. he sent
George Byng to him on Sunday to invite him to say what he thought would be the
most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> eligible course to adopt in the present state of affairs, and with
reference to the Government bill. This was not very judicious on his part, and
Granville was an odd man to select, being in a different House of Parliament,
and so bound to Palmerston that he could not avoid communicating to him the
overture and his reply to it. George Byng says Granville appeared a good deal
surprised, but he thought rather pleased. Granville said he could give no
immediate answer, but would write to him, which he did the next day, and told
him George Lewis would go down to Pembroke Lodge to see Lord John. I have no
idea that anything will come of this, for none of the late Cabinet can or will
transfer their allegiance from Palmerston to Lord John, unless the former
consents to it, and abdicates his position of chief of the Whig party, which he
seems to have no thoughts of doing, and it is impossible to conciliate their
rival claims and pretensions.</p>


<div class="sidenote">MR. DISRAELI'S INDIA BILL.</div>

<p><i>April 2nd.</i>&mdash;A letter from the Duke of Bedford this morning says that Lord John
is inclined to throw out the India Bill, as it is too bad to admit of any
improvement, and that he thinks if he does this Palmerston will support him; but
the Duke adds that it is rumoured that the Government will not go out if their
bill is defeated. It is easy to understand that Palmerston can desire nothing so
much as that Lord John should take the lead in opposing the India Bill, and that
he should support him, because in that case, and the defeat of the bill by a
large majority, which probably would happen, and the Government going out, he
would infallibly be sent for again, and in re-forming his Government he would no
doubt invite Lord John to join it, but this would only lead to a fresh series of
difficulties, and most likely to a long course of abortive negotiations. How the
junction between the two leaders is to be effected it is difficult to conceive,
although there are several ways in which it might be brought about, if they were
disposed to make mutual concessions. The starting point might be the complete
union of the whole Whig and Liberal party, which all profess to desire most
anxiously, and which the mutual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> antipathies and disagreements of the two
leaders at present prevent. If Palmerston would consent to go to the House of
Lords as Premier, and to leave Lord John with a high office (India, for example)
as leader in the House of Commons, something might be done. Lord John might
possibly be induced to cede his claim to the highest place on this condition,
but it is not unlikely that he would require more than that: first, that
Clarendon should not be at the Foreign Office, which Palmerston would no doubt
not agree to; and secondly, certain places and seats in the Cabinet for the
Peelites, who have recently consented to follow his standard and cast their own
lots with his. Then various complications present themselves connected with
these questions.</p>


<p><i>April 4th.</i>&mdash;The Duke of Bedford has written to Lady Derby that her lord must
make up his mind to be beaten on his India Bill, but that he hopes he will not
think it necessary to resign upon it when he is. Brougham writes from Paris that
the feeling against us there has been greatly exaggerated, that the Emperor
<i>alone</i> is friendly to us, but that though the general sentiment is unfriendly,
nobody dreams of going to war with us, nor indeed with any other Power.</p>


<p><i>April 8th.</i>&mdash;Derby made a striking speech at the Mansion House the other night,
which has been severely ridiculed by the 'Times,' but which nevertheless
contained a good deal of truth. He said that there were very few questions
nowadays in which different Governments <i>could</i> act differently, and he invited
not only every sort of criticism, but of suggestion, as to the Indian Bills and
measures now before Parliament. The inference deducible from his speech (and in
which I have since been confirmed) is that, happen what may, he does not mean to
resign, and that the Government will not go out, unless they are positively
turned out. They say this unlucky India Bill was the sole work of Ellenborough,
and that the democratic clauses are the result of an old fancy of his, but
nobody can be desirous of admitting the paternity of such a measure.</p>


<div class="sidenote">LORD JOHN RUSSELL'S RESOLUTIONS.</div>

<p><i>April 16th.</i>&mdash;I have been confined to the house for several days, and unable to
mix in the world and hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> what is going on, but have seen enough to know that
there is nothing but confusion, perplexity, and irritation in the political
world. During the brief recess everybody was speculating about what would be
done when Parliament met again, what was to be the fate of the rival India
Bills, and how far the Government would be affected by the result of contests
concerning them. The Government hangers-on affected to be very well satisfied
with the state of affairs, and proclaimed their intention not to go out whatever
might happen with regard to their bills. The Palmerstonians evidently expected
that such storms would arise as the Government would not be able to weather, and
that something would turn up advantageous to them. John Russell, who must be
doing something, said that the Government bill was so bad that no alterations
could make it tolerable, and that he was disposed to move some Resolutions,
which might be the foundation of a really good measure. He concocted these
Resolutions, and wrote word to the Duke that 'he had written to George Lewis and
to Macaulay, who both approved of his scheme.' Accordingly, as soon as
Parliament met he announced that Resolutions ought to be drawn up, and that he
was ready to draw them up. This produced great excitement. The Government saw in
this move a plank of safety for themselves, and Disraeli said he was ready to
receive Lord John's Resolutions, or to draw up Resolutions of his own; many
people said that if Resolutions were to be drawn up at all, it ought to be by
Government, and not by any independent member, and it was eventually settled
that Disraeli was to do it. Everybody saw that this, as far as it went, was
advantageous to the Government; it gave them certainly a reprieve, and possibly
an opportunity of ridding themselves of the Indian difficulty altogether for
this year, and the consequence was a burst of indignation and resentment against
Lord John for thus coming to their aid as it was called, and concerting such a
measure (as he was accused of doing) with Disraeli himself. The 'Times' attacked
him with the utmost bitterness, and there is a general clamour against him on
the part of the late Government and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> their friends. It is not very easy to
divine his true motives in this matter. To judge by the asperity with which he
has spoken of the Government bill, one should not suppose he could be moved by
any auxiliary purpose to them, and I do not believe there has been any concert,
direct or indirect, between them; but as all parties agree that the Government
have derived advantage from his move, the rage he has excited is not
unreasonable, and the breach between him and the Palmerstonian Whigs is much
widened, and become more difficult to heal. Granville, who I suppose speaks the
sentiments of his colleagues, says that it is evident they could not return to
office with the <i>same</i> Government exactly as before, and that it is not
desirable to turn the Government out at present, even if they could, and he
thinks it would not be wise to attempt to carry Palmerston's India Bill, in
which it is not sure they should succeed. He thinks there <i>was</i> concert between
Lord John and Disraeli, not direct, but through Horsman, and he says that George
Lewis, so far from approving his Resolutions, strongly protested against them;
but it is not impossible to reconcile two statements which seem at first sight
to be directly opposed to each other. Lord John says he imparted to George Lewis
and Macaulay his <i>scheme</i> (i.e. of drawing up Resolutions), not the Resolutions
themselves, while George Lewis seems to deny approval of the Resolutions; but
this is only a possible solution of the apparent contradictions.</p>

<p>I told Granville that all that was now happening only served to confirm my
original opinion, that they were wrong in resigning, and that there was no
occasion for their doing so, and they now saw how difficult it was, when they
had let this Government in, to get them out again, and he not only had not a
word to say in reply, but all he did was rather indicative of concurrence in my
opinion. In the most palmy days of party government, and when the old traditions
with regard to the relations of Government with the House of Commons were in
full force, it was not considered as an invariable and unavoidable necessity
that a Government when beaten on an important question must go out. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> recollect
the Government of the day in 1815 being beaten on the Income Tax, without
therefore resigning, and it is so obvious that the vote on the French despatch
did not imply any general withdrawal of confidence and support, that I never
shall believe they would have resigned as they did unless they had thought they
should gain more strength and power by doing so without losing their places, and
consequently that they were caught in a trap of their own setting.</p>


<div class="sidenote">MR. DISRAELI'S BUDGET.</div>

<p><i>April 24th.</i>&mdash;The events of the past week have been Disraeli's Budget, which
has been received with favour and excited no opposition in any quarter, and the
withdrawal of the Government India Bill, which was done by Disraeli, rather
unwillingly; but their maxim seems to be 'anything for a quiet life,' and they
agree to whatever is proposed or opposed in any influential quarter. The general
notion is that they are safe for this session, but it is a very inglorious
safety. It now appears as if they would scramble and hobble on until the whole
Liberal party is reunited, and a reconciliation effected between Palmerston and
John Russell, to bring about which it is clear that much exertion is being made.</p>

<p>While I was at Newmarket this week I had several letters from the Duke of
Bedford, all bearing upon this matter. He writes on the 16th: 'I hear that the
feeling against John has been very strong and that lies have been told as usual.
It is said that he has been in communication with Derby indirectly, through Lady
Derby, and that he wrote to Disraeli. If he did, it was only on a matter of
ordinary courtesy, to ask him to postpone the second reading of the India Bill,
to give time for a different course which he intended to suggest and did the
first day the House met. John has been left by circumstances or by his old
colleagues to pursue his own independent course, and ought not to be found fault
with, if he pursued that course, as he did in this instance, after conferring
with the friends I named to you, and receiving their approval. No doubt his move
was very successful to the Government, and helped them out of an enormous
difficulty, but I can see no harm in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> that.' There was a great deal more about
the communications between Lord John and George Lewis, which now only signifies
as demonstrating the extreme difficulty of getting at the truth. It is evident
that there is a great desire on the part of the Whigs to bring about a reunion
with Lord John and those who follow him, in order to get the Government out, for
which the rant and file are getting more and more impatient. Lewis told me last
night that <i>they</i> are holding constant Cabinets, which always ended with the
same resolution, not to do anything, or to make any serious attack; and they
have made up their minds to acquiesce in Derby's going on through this session;
but nothing can exceed the contempt and aversion with which Lewis speaks of the
Government and of all their proceedings, certainly not without reason, for there
is no example of any Government consenting to hold office on terms so
humiliating, and to such a powerless existence. They dare not originate
anything, and they submit to everything that anybody proposes or suggests,
having seemingly no object but that of currying favour, and avoiding to give
offence. The way in which Disraeli withdrew his India Bill upon a few words
spoken by John Russell is a curious exemplification of their forlorn state.</p>

<p>Lord Cowley, whom I saw yesterday, is desirous, like everybody else, to see the
end of this feeble rule; but he thinks Palmerston's disposition is very
unbending, and doubts his and Lord John's being brought together,
notwithstanding that Lady Palmerston tells the Duke of Bedford that Palmerston
'has a great affection for John.' Cowley talked a great deal about French
affairs and the state of things between the two countries, and he expressed
great apprehensions lest Malmesbury should make too many concessions to the
French Government,<a name="FNanchor_1_31" id="FNanchor_1_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_31" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which, however, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> meant to prevent if he could. He
mentioned one or two odd things. First of all he told me that he had foreseen
all the effects produced by the Walewski letter, and had done all he could to
prevent its being sent, and he was amazed at Clarendon having taken it so
quietly, and that he should have seen no impropriety or danger in it, but on the
contrary thought it would do good. Then with regard to Walewski's other letter
in reply to Malmesbury, which, objectionable as it was, had been greatly
softened from the original draft, had it been despatched as at first composed by
Walewski, he said it would have raised an inextinguishable flame here. Cowley
said that the Emperor's nerves were shaken to pieces by the <i>attentat</i>, and he
was greatly changed.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_31" id="Footnote_1_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_31"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [The publication of Lord Malmesbury's autobiography has proved that
he was not at all disposed to make any undue concessions to the French
Government, and that he acted as long as this Administration lasted in strict
union with Lord Cowley. The Emperor Napoleon complained that his old friend
assumed too stern an attitude towards France in the course of the events which
followed in the next few months and led to the Italian War.]</p></div>


<div class="sidenote">DECADENCE OF THE MINISTRY.</div>

<p><i>April 29th.</i>&mdash;Every day the position of the Government gets worse and worse.
The disposition there was to give them a fair opportunity of carrying on public
affairs as well as they could has given way to disgust and contempt at their
blundering and stupidity, and those who have all along resented their attempt to
hold office at all are becoming more impatient and more anxious to turn them
out. There is a very temperate, but very just, article in the 'Times' to-day,
which contains all that is to be said on the subject, stated without bitterness
or exaggeration. The Whigs, however, seem aware that it is not expedient to push
matters to extremity, and to force their resignation, until the quarrels of the
Liberal party are made up, and till Palmerston and John Russell are brought
together and prepared to join in taking office, and to effect this object the
most strenuous efforts are making. What the pacificators aim at is, that
Palmerston should go as Premier to the House of Lords, and leave Lord John to
lead the House of Commons. This is the most reasonable compromise, and one which
ought to be satisfactory to both; but even if this leading condition were agreed
to, it is not certain that there might not be others presenting great obstacles
to the union, such as whether Lord John would agree to join without bringing a
certain number of men with him, and whether Palmerston would consent to exclude
so many of his former Cabinet to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> make room for them. Graham, Lord John would, I
suppose, certainly insist upon; Gladstone would probably be no party to any
arrangement, and he has recently evinced his extreme antipathy to Palmerston by
a bitter though able review in the 'Quarterly' on France and the late Ministry,
in which he attacks Palmerston with extraordinary asperity.</p>

<p>Ever since he resigned Palmerston has been very active in the House of Commons,
and kept himself constantly before the public, evidently with the object of
recovering his former popularity as much as possible, and he made a very clever
and lively speech two nights ago, which his friends praise up to the skies.</p>

<p>I met Derby in the Park yesterday, and soon after the Chancellor in Piccadilly,
and had some talk with both of them. They were neither of them in a very
sanguine mood, and apparently well aware of the precariousness of their
position. Derby attributed the state of affairs, which he owned was very bad, to
the caprice and perverseness of the House of Commons, which he said was
unmanageable. I did not, as I might have done, tell him that he had no right to
complain of this House, and that it was the mismanagement of his own colleagues
which was the cause of the evil. Lyndhurst made an extraordinary speech on the
Jew Bill on Tuesday night.</p>


<p><i>May 1st.</i>&mdash;Ellice flattered himself that he could get up a party in the House
of Commons which would have power enough to stop the progress of the Indian
measure, and to lead to a better measure next year, as well as to the formation
of a Government; and in pursuance of this scheme it was arranged that Lord Harry
Vane should move the postponement of Indian legislation, and Ellice told me they
should be supported by 150, and many men of note. All this went off in smoke
last night. After a short debate the motion was rejected by an immense majority,
and Ellice could only muster 55 people.</p>

<p>The hopes of those who are trying to bring Lord John and Palmerston together are
damped by a letter I have received (and shown to George Byng) from the Duke of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
Bedford, who says: 'I saw much, of Palmerston and Lady Palmerston last week, but
could see no disposition to reunion, although we came to that point more than
once. I suggested to Lady Palmerston the wish of many that Palmerston should go
to the House of Lords. She said that Palmerston had always entertained a great
dislike to it, and hinted, or more than hinted, that he would place no
confidence in John as leader of the House of Commons.' I went to hear Professor
Owen lecture yesterday. His style of lecturing is very good, but the subject
(vertebrated animals) was too scientific for my ignorance.</p>


<p><i>Savernake, May 11th.</i>&mdash;I have been out of town all the last week, at Chester,
and came here on Saturday. While I was at Chester the Duke of Bedford sent me a
note he had received from Lord John, which looked like the beginning of a
<i>rapprochement</i> between him and Palmerston, though it did not amount to a great
deal, and may lead to nothing. I was obliged to return it, and was too much
occupied to copy the contents of it here. I refer so often to this subject,
because it appears to be the one upon which the existence of the present
Government depends, for as soon as the Liberals can come to an understanding and
act in concert, the doom of the Ministry will be sealed. Without their
committing any great faults they seem to be falling into greater contempt every
day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD CANNING'S OUDE PROCLAMATION.</div>

<p>The only point of attack the Opposition have found has been the affair of
Canning's recent Proclamation.<a name="FNanchor_1_32" id="FNanchor_1_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_32" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Canning has not been lucky in his
Proclamations, the first having been severely criticised for its clemency, and
the second for its severity. The complaint against the Government is for having
made public their disapproval of it and their censure of his acts. I think their
disapprobation quite right, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> that they were right in conveying it to
Canning, but they might have refused to express any opinion or to publish or
half publish any of the correspondence that passed, though it cannot be doubted
that such refusal would have drawn upon them all sorts of attacks and
reproaches, but it would have been the proper course for them to adopt. It is,
however, certainly premature to express any definite opinion upon an act of
which we are not yet furnished with an explanation.</p>

<p>I went yesterday to see Littlecote House, Mr. Popham's, a very curious,
interesting old house, and the scene of the Wild Dayrell story and murder, the
tradition of which has been often narrated, but the truth never ascertained. I
saw all the rooms, including the one in which the murder is supposed to have
been committed, but they have been much altered. There is a fine old hall, hung
round with the armour and buff coats of Colonel Popham's troopers, and it is a
remarkable fact that they are all so small that no man of ordinary size could
wear them, a clear proof that the present generation are much bigger than our
ancestors of two centuries ago. King William III. slept at Littlecote for two or
three nights in 1689 (while King James was at Salisbury), and he seems to have
left behind him a good many papers, which have ever since been preserved in the
house. There is also a large collection of miscellaneous letters of the time of
the Civil War, more or less curious, which were preserved by a lucky accident.
Popham told me that his father told him there was a mass of papers in an old box
under the roof of the house which had better be destroyed. His son went up for
the purpose, and discovered the contents of the box, saved the papers, and had
them arranged in a book. I urged him to publish them, and I hope he will. I had
only time to look over a few of them; as autographs alone they are valuable.<a name="FNanchor_2_33" id="FNanchor_2_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_33" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WHIGS NEGOTIATE.</div>

<p><i>London, May 13th.</i>&mdash;Nothing ever was like the state of confusion and excitement
which has prevailed here during the last fortnight, while I have been out of
town, particularly on the resignation of Ellenborough, which took everybody by
surprise. Before I went away the impression had become general that this
Government neither could nor ought to be endured much longer, and that their
repeated and enormous blunders made them a nuisance which must be abated. All
the Liberals (except some of the extreme Radicals who wished them to stay on
some time longer), however they differed on other questions, were agreed on
this. Numerous meetings took place, and there was a prodigious activity of
negotiation, communication, and going backwards and forwards, with a view to
some general organisation and combination of attack on the unfortunate Ministry.
The Duke of Bedford was brought up to see what he could do to bring Lord John
and Palmerston together. Lord John joined heartily in the plan of turning the
Government out, and said that <i>anything</i> was preferable to leaving them any
longer in office. Clarendon, who had been informed of Lord John's peculiar
grudge against him, expressed a wish to have an interview with him, which the
Duke brought about. Lord John called on Clarendon, and they had a frank
communication, so far as Lord John telling him all that he thought about foreign
affairs, and in what he disagreed with the late Government on various questions;
but he did not allude to Vienna, which is the real gist of his grievance and the
source of his hostile feeling, so that with that reticence it is not strange
that they should have parted much as they met. Then Palmerston expressed a wish
to have a <i>tï¿½te-ï¿½-tï¿½te</i> conversation with Lord John, which the latter assented
to, but Palmerston seems to have changed his mind, and to have shrunk from it
when the opportunity presented itself. Charles Wood is the man who has been
constantly communicating with Lord John in behalf of the Whig Cabinet, and one
day Palmerston came into Charles Wood's while Lord John was there. It rained,
and Palmerston offered to take Lord John home, which he accepted, but nothing
passed on the way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> nor did Palmerston propose to get out and enter the house
when he might have had the conversation he had expressed a wish for, and so it
ended. The plans imagined by mutual friends for effecting a political
reconciliation have vanished into air. Palmerston is resolved not to go to the
House of Lords, and Lord John is equally determined not to take office under
him. Palmerston says he cannot trust Lord John to lead the House of Commons.
Personally, meanwhile, they are ostensibly friends, and Lord John dines at
Cambridge House to-morrow. Charles Wood asked the Duke of Bedford, supposing the
Government resigned, and Palmerston was again sent for, what he thought
Palmerston ought to do, to which he replied that he ought to accept the task,
send to Lord John, and on his refusal to join (as he probably would), to do the
best he could with the materials he could command. This advice would, I
conceive, be very palateable to Palmerston, and it is what he would naturally do
without any advice.</p>

<p>I called on Lyndhurst the night I came to town, and found him very dissatisfied
with the Government, both on account of their management and errors, and because
they have treated him with personal neglect; he had begged Derby and Disraeli to
do something for his son-in-law, but both put him off with excuses, and would do
nothing. He is particularly disgusted with the state of the Jew question, and
with the foolish and obstinate conduct of the Government in the House of Lords
about it, on which he was very eloquent, particularly for their having made a
great whip, and getting up every man they could lay hands on to come and vote,
instead of leaving it to take its chance, and at least making an open question
of it.</p>


<p><i>May 16th.</i>&mdash;The first great battle took place in the House of Lords the night
before last, at which I was present.<a name="FNanchor_1_34" id="FNanchor_1_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_34" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

Shaftesbury in the House of Lords, where it was defeated by a majority of nine.
The debate in the House of Commons lasted four nights, and in the interval Lord
Ellenborough resigned. Mr. Cardwell then withdrew his motion, and the attack on
the Government suddenly collapsed.]</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">DEBATES ON THE OUDE PROCLAMATION.</div>

<p>It was a very spirited fight, and I never recollect seeing the House of Lords so
crowded both with ladies and lords. Pretty good speaking; Lord Grey's was about
the best speech and the one I most agreed with. I cannot see the matter of
Canning's Proclamation and Ellenborough's despatch in the light that either side
does, and think there is much to be said both ways. In the Commons the fight
began on Friday also, and the most remarkable speech in it was that of Cairns,
the new Solicitor-General, which was very clever and effective. John Russell
also spoke very well and vigorously, quite in his old style. There is much
difference of opinion as to the amount of majority, though it is generally
expected there will be one against Government, and I now hear that they have
determined positively to dissolve if they are beaten, though with little or no
chance of their bettering themselves by a dissolution.</p>


<div class="sidenote">MR. CARDWELL WITHDRAWS HIS MOTION.</div>

<p><i>May 23rd</i>.&mdash;The excitement of Epsom during the whole of last week was not
greater than that which prevailed in London during the great debates in the
House of Commons, the result of which, on Thursday night, produced such unusual
surprise, with so much triumph on one side and such mortification and
disappointment on the other. In my long experience I do not recollect to have
seen so much political bitterness and violence (except perhaps during the great
contests of the Catholic question and Reform), and certainly there never was a
great Parliamentary battle distinguished by so much uncertainty and so many
vicissitudes, and in which the end corresponded so little with the beginning and
with the general expectation. For a considerable time not only all the late
Cabinet and their supporters, but the whole body of Whigs, both Palmerstonians
and Russellites, had been growing more and more impatient of the Derby
Government, and they were considering how they could make a final and
irresistible attack upon them, and for the last three weeks there had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
nothing but negotiations and <i>pourparlers</i> to effect a coalition between the
rival leaders and their friends for the purpose of their at least uniting in one
great hostile vote, which should drive the Derbyites to resignation or
dissolution, hoping and expecting that their majority would be so large as to
put the latter out of the question. The occasion seemed to present itself upon
Ellenborough's letter to Canning censuring his Proclamation. A meeting took
place at Cambridge House, when the whole plan was matured, and though John
Russell did not attend it, he agreed to be a party to the Motion of Censure.
Shaftesbury was put forward in the Lords, and Cardwell was induced to take the
initiative in the House of Commons. Nobody doubted of success, and the only
question was (much debated and betted upon) by how many the Government would be
beaten. Meanwhile Ellenborough resigned, which gave a new aspect to the affair,
and the Government got a small majority in the Lords. It was evident that no
popularity attached to the motion, and many of the Liberals were of opinion that
upon Ellenborough's resignation the affair ought to drop and the motion be
withdrawn. But the die was cast, the Palmerstonians were quite confident and
eager for the fray, and would not hear of stopping in their career. The debate
began, the speaking being all along better on the Government side, and every day
their prospects as to the division appeared to be mending and public opinion
more and more inclining against the Opposition and the Proclamation, though
still blaming Ellenborough's letter. If the debate had ended on Tuesday as was
expected, Government would probably have been beaten, but Sir Charles Napier had
got Tuesday, and would not give it up, so that the decision was of necessity
adjourned; the delay was all in favour of the Government, and on Thursday night
arrived the Indian despatches with Canning's explanations and the Outram
correspondence, which was immediately published, and although Palmerston and his
friends and newspapers pretended that they considered these documents favourable
to their cause, the general impression was rather the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> way. All this time
the Government people found their cause improving, and their chances in the
division mending, and though their enemies still pretended to be certain of
success, and I was told on Thursday night that I might safely lay any odds on
their having a majority, the best informed of them in the House of Commons began
to see danger, and at last they confessed only to expect a bare majority, and
the Speaker told somebody it was very likely he should have to give a casting
vote. The Radicals, or those of them who professed to be adherents of the Whig
Cabinet, strongly urged the withdrawal of Cardwell's motion, and at last on the
Thursday seem to have made up their minds that defeat in some shape was
inevitable, and that the best thing left for them to do was to get rid of the
debate in any way they could. Henry Lennox called on me yesterday morning to
tell me what had passed, to this effect: that on Friday Disraeli had received a
letter from Cardwell, in which he asked if Disraeli would allow him to withdraw
his motion, and subsequently Palmerston desired to confer with him, when he put
the same question to him, to which (according to Henry Lennox's statement)
Disraeli replied, in a very lofty tone, that he would hear of nothing which
could possibly be construed into any admission on their part of their meriting
any part of the censure which the Opposition had been labouring to cast upon
them. The Government had by this time ascertained that the Opposition had made
their minds up to back out of the motion as best they might, and their retreat
was not very cleverly done, beginning with Cardwell's refusal to withdraw, and
ending with Palmerston's recommendation to him to yield, which was a got up
thing. The scene in the House was most extraordinary, and particularly
mortifying to Palmerston, who saw himself involved in inevitable defeat, and
without the power of rallying again for some time. If anybody could be excused
for the impatience which brought him and his party into this dilemma, it was
Palmerston, who in his seventy fourth year, and resolved to die in harness if he
could, had no time to lose. This affair has been the battle of Marengo of
political warfare. The Whigs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> appeared to be victorious, and carrying everything
before them up to the eleventh hour, and then came a sudden turn of affairs, and
the promise of victory was turned into rout and disaster. The campaign is lost,
and for the rest of this session the Government have it all their own way. The
Whigs are in the condition of a defeated army, who require to be completely
reorganized and re-formed before they can take the field again. The general
resentment and mortification are extreme. They have naturally lost all
confidence in their leaders, and they are now all ready to complain of the
tactics of which they entirely approved till they found that defeat had been the
consequence of their adoption. It is not probable that Palmerston and his late
Cabinet will attempt anything more during this session, and everything is in
such a state of confusion and uncertainty that the best thing they can do is to
remain quiet, merely in a state of watchfulness, and to see what the <i>volvenda
dies</i> may bring about in the course of the next six months, leaving the
Derbyites unmolested during that time. Derby will get Gladstone if possible to
take the India Board, and this will be the best thing that can happen. His
natural course is to be at the head of a Conservative Government, and he may, if
he acts with prudence, be the means of raising that party to something like
dignity and authority, and emancipating it from its dependence on the
discreditable and insincere support of the Radicals.</p>


<p><i>June 7th.</i>&mdash;At Cleveden, at Ascot, and at Hatchford all the past week, during
which I heard little or nothing about politics. The matter which made the most
stir was Disraeli's impudent and mendacious speech at Slough, in which he
bitterly attacked the last Ministry and glorified his own. The Whigs were stung
to madness, and two or three nights were occupied in both Houses, principally by
Palmerston and Clarendon, in answering this speech, and demonstrating its
falsehood. The proceeding was not very dignified, and they might just as well
have left it alone, particularly as nobody cared much about what Disraeli said;
but there was so little sympathy for the ex-Ministers, that no indignation was
ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>cited by it, except among themselves and their immediate friends. There seems
little chance now of anything but a desultory warfare going on in the House of
Commons, without any serious attack on the Government, who seem safe for this
session at least. The most interesting event last week was the virtual
settlement of the eternal Jew Question, which the House of Lords sulkily
acquiesced in. It was very desirable for many reasons to put an end to it.</p>


<div class="sidenote">UNPOPULARITY OF LORD PALMERSTON.</div>

<p><i>Norman Court, June 16th.</i>&mdash;Every day it appears more and more evident that
Palmerston's political career is drawing to a close, and he alone seems blind to
the signs which denote it. Few things are stranger than the violent reaction
which has deprived him of his popularity, and made him an object of bitter
aversion to a considerable part of the Liberals, not only to such men as Graham
and Bright, but even to many of his former followers and adherents. I cannot say
I am sorry for it, but I do in fairness think that this reaction is overdone and
exaggerated, and the hostility to Palmerston greater than there is any reason
for. I do not wish to see him again at the head of affairs, but I should be
sorry to see a man so distinguished, who has been exalted so high, and who has
many good qualities, end his life, or at least his political career, under
circumstances of mortification and humiliation. If this happens it will be owing
principally to his obstinacy in persisting in leading a party who have no longer
any mind to be led by him, and the insatiable ambition which cannot brook the
notion of retirement at any time of life. If he was wise, and was not blinded by
vanity and the flattery of his hangers-on, he would take a juster and clearer
view of his position, and supposing him still intent on playing the political
game, he would endeavour to act a part as nearly like that which Peel acted in
his last years as the difference of circumstances would admit.</p>

<p>But the determination to have no more to do with Palmerston has not made the
Whigs and Liberals more disposed to throw themselves into the arms of Lord John,
and as yet, so far from any appearance of a reorganisation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> Liberal
party, they seem more disunited and scattered than ever. Even Lord John and
Graham, who seemed to be most closely allied, are now continually voting
different ways; and as to the other leading men, it is impossible to predict how
they will vote on any subject that comes before Parliament. In this state of
confusion many Liberal-Conservatives are beginning to wish for the consolidation
of the Government, and are inclining to support it, if the Government itself
will give them an opportunity of doing so, by asserting their own independence
as a <i>Conservative</i> Government, and will leave off truckling to the Radicals, by
accepting measures which everyone knows to be repugnant to their feelings and
opinions, and inconsistent with the principles they have always professed. Men
who supported Palmerston's Government because they considered it to be a
Conservative one, foresee that before long parties must assume the character of
Radical and Conservative, the Whigs being merged in the former, and that the
party of the present Government forms the only force capable of resisting the
Whig and Radical union when it takes place, and that their best course will be
to join the Conservative camp, if the present Government do not, by unprincipled
and inconsistent concessions for the sake of an easy official existence, render
it impossible for them to do so. I do not know to what extent this feeling
prevails, but I believe it is extending, and Lord St. Germans, who is a very
staunch friend to the late Government, and latterly belonged to them, told me
the other day that Granville had great difficulty in keeping his people
together. Ashburton is very warm and eager in this sense, and though neither of
these men have much weight, I have no doubt they are exponents of the sentiments
of a much larger number. I called on Lyndhurst on Monday evening, and talked
this question over with him, and entreated him to speak to Derby upon it. We
were very well agreed, and he said he would endeavour to talk to Derby, but he
is rather embarrassed, because he does not know what Derby is going to do about
the Jew Bill, there being some strange signs of an intention on the part of
Derby to throw it over after all, though this would be so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> extremely foolish, as
well as so false and dishonourable, that I cannot believe it is in his
contemplation.</p>


<div class="sidenote">MINISTERS GAIN GROUND.</div>

<p><i>June 22nd.</i>&mdash;During the week I passed at Norman Court the Government here were
gaining ground. They had two good divisions in the House of Commons, sufficient
to prove that if they cannot command a majority here, they have at least as much
influence and power and are as well supported as any other leader or party. Then
the publication of the Cagliari papers, and the way in which that question was
settled, was a real triumph to the Foreign Office, and acknowledged to be so by
the whole Press of every shade, and by everybody in Parliament, not excepting
the ex-Ministers themselves. They are undoubtedly gaining strength, while the
chances of another Palmerston Government become more and more faint and remote.
All information coincides in representing Palmerston's unpopularity as great and
general, certainly the most extraordinary change that ever took place in so
short a time. The Duke of Bedford writes to me from Endsleigh: 'I hear of only
one general feeling against Palmerston in the West. What a change since this
time last year!'</p>

<p>I had a long talk with Tom Baring at Norman Court about the Government, their
proceedings and their prospects, and we agreed entirely on the subject. I wanted
him to speak to some of his friends the ministers, and to endeavour to get them
to act a bolder and more consistent part as a Conservative Government, and he
urged me to speak to Disraeli, which I told him I would do, and only refrained
from doubting if I could do any real good with him. The Government are certainly
placed in a difficult position. The Government and party whom they replaced were
determined to thrust them out again as soon as possible, and their weakness and
danger drove them into a quasi-alliance with the Radicals, or at least into so
much deference and so many concessions to Radicals and Ultra-Liberals, that the
Whigs, who were baffled and kept out by this policy, held them up to bitter
scorn and reproach for acting in this manner, and now, when they agree to any
measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> with regard to which concession is reasonable and prudent, they are
always assailed with the same reproaches instead of getting credit for so doing.
To be sure they often contrive to make their concessions in such a way as to
deprive them of all grace and merit. This has been pre-eminently the case with
the Jew Bill.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ADMISSION OF THE JEWS TO PARLIAMENT.</div>

<p>Among the events of last week one of the most interesting was the Queen's visit
to Birmingham, where she was received by the whole of that enormous population
with an enthusiasm which is said to have exceeded all that was ever displayed in
her former receptions at Manchester or elsewhere. It is impossible not to regard
such manifestations as both significant and important. They evince a disposition
in those masses of the population in which, if anywhere, the seeds of Radicalism
are supposed to lurk, most favourable to the Conservative cause, by which I mean
not to this or that party, but to the Monarchy and the Constitution under which
we are living and flourishing, and which we may believe to be still dear to the
hearts of the people of this country. This great fact lends some force to the
notion entertained by many political thinkers, that there is more danger in
conferring political power on the middle classes than in extending it far
beneath them, and in point of fact that there is so little to be apprehended
from the extension of the suffrage, that universal suffrage itself would be
innocuous. Amongst the concessions of last week was the passing of Locke King's
Bill for abolishing a property qualification, which was done with hardly any
opposition. There can be no doubt that the practice was a mere sham, and that a
property qualification was very often a fiction or a fraud, and such being the
case, that it was useless to keep up the distinction; but it struck me, though I
do not find that it occurred to anybody else, that the abolition might sooner or
later have an indirect influence upon the question of the suffrage, for it may
be urged, not without plausibility, that if it be held no longer necessary that
a representative should have any property whatever, there is great inconsistency
in requiring that the elector<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> should have a certain amount of property to
entitle him to vote.</p>


<p><i>June 26th.</i>&mdash;The India Bill appears now likely to pass rather rapidly and in
the shape presented by the Government. Everybody is tired to death of the
subject and anxious to have it over, and the general impatience is increased by
alarm at the foul state of the Thames, which (long discussed in a negligent way,
and without much public attention or care) has suddenly assumed vast
proportions, and is become an object of general interest and apprehension. This
makes the House of Commons eager to finish its business as expeditiously as it
can, and members impatient to betake themselves to a purer and safer atmosphere.
The Government continues to maintain its ascendency there, and last night
Palmerston was beaten by considerable majorities on two amendments he moved to
the India Bill.</p>

<p>The Chancellor has drawn down great obloquy on himself by a speech which he made
at the Mansion House a night or two ago. Derby's illness having prevented his
going to the dinner (given to the Ministers), Thesiger had to speak for him, and
he made the very worst, most injudicious, and unbecoming speech which was ever
delivered on such an occasion. No rule is more established than that politics
are not to be introduced at these dinners, and yet his speech was nothing but a
political song of triumph and glorification of his own Government and
colleagues, as somebody said, a counterpart (though less offensive one) of
Disraeli's Slough speech. All their heads are turned, and the Chancellor's as
much or more than any.</p>

<p>Then there is a grand mess about the Jew question, which is hung up in a sort of
abeyance in consequence of Derby's not being able to come down to the House of
Lords. From the moment that Derby took upon himself to announce his abandonment
of the contest, which he did not frankly and fully, but sulkily and reluctantly,
he seems to have half repented of what he did, and to have, if not made,
permitted and connived at, all sorts of difficulties and obstacles, while his
subordinates and some of his colleagues have interposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> to prevent or delay the
final settlement. It is difficult to believe that he himself ever cared a straw
about the Jew question, or that his opposition had any motive except that of
pleasing the bigoted and narrow-minded of his party. His good sense saw that the
moment was come when surrender was the best policy if not an absolute necessity,
and having given utterance to this conviction, no doubt to the enormous disgust
of many of his followers, it was his interest to get rid of the question as
quickly as possible, and dismiss what as long as it remained on the <i>tapis</i> in
any shape was a source of disagreement and ill-humour between him and his party.
It is marvellous, therefore, that so clever a man should have acted so foolish a
part as he has done. Having disgusted his own party by his concession, he is now
disgusting everybody else and all other parties by his hesitation and
pusillanimity in carrying it out, and, with an absence of dignity and firmness
which is utterly unworthy of the high position he holds, he has permitted his
Chancellor and some half-dozen subordinate members of his Government to do all
they can to thwart the settlement of the question, and prolong the exclusion of
the Jews. Instead of taking the matter into his own hands, and dealing with it
according to the plain suggestions of common sense and sound policy, he has
permitted a sort of little conspiracy to go on, which is exceedingly likely to
bring about a collision between the two Houses, and to raise a flame in the
House of Commons the consequences of which may be more serious to the Government
than any one contemplates. Lyndhurst, whose wise head is provoked and disgusted
to the last degree at all these proceedings, has bitterly complained of them,
and at the way in which they have treated him, and the bill he drew up for the
express purpose of putting an end to the dilemma.</p>


<p><i>July 9th.</i>&mdash;After all Derby ran true to the Jew Bill, and if he did it in an
awkward way, allowances must be made for him and for his difficulties with his
party, who are full of chagrin at being compelled to swallow this obnoxious
measure. It is on the whole better that the bulk of them should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> voted in
conformity with their notorious opinions, as it made no difference as to the
result, and has a better appearance than if they had whisked round at Derby's
bidding. The India Bill has passed the House of Commons pretty harmoniously, and
people seem to think it has been licked into a very decent shape.</p>

<p>The most interesting event of the present day is the marriage of Lord
Overstone's daughter to a Major Lindsay,<a name="FNanchor_1_35" id="FNanchor_1_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_35" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> who has got the greatest heiress who
ever existed, that is, supposing she inherits her father's prodigious wealth,
which since old Jones Loyd's death is reckoned to amount to six or seven
millions.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_35" id="Footnote_1_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_35"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [Afterwards Sir Robert Loyd Lindsay, V.C., raised to the Peerage in
1885 by the title of Lord Wantage. The property of Lord Overstone, as disposed
of by his will, amounted to about three millions, and would pass in reversion to
the Loyd family on the failure of issue by his daughter.]</p></div>


<p><i>July 13th.</i>&mdash;After an ineffectual attempt on the part of the Opposition to get
rid of the 'reasons' of the Lords, the Jew Bill has passed, Granville and
Lansdowne protesting against the absurdity of the conduct of Derby with regard
to it. It is remarkable that though Lord Lansdowne has for some time appeared
much <i>baissï¿½</i>, his speech was as good and sensible a speech as he ever made in
his life. As to Derby, as it is impossible that so clever a man as he is could
willingly act so foolish and even ridiculous a part as he has done on this
occasion, I conclude that he felt obliged to do what he has done in order to
avoid quarrelling with his own friends, who without doubt are intensely
disgusted at the bitter pill he has obliged them to swallow, and as he knows
best what he can venture with them and what not, it is more reasonable to accept
the measure on his own terms than to be angry with him for the way in which he
has contrived it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONTINUED WARFARE IN INDIA.</div>

<p>The last accounts from India are far from satisfactory, and the apprehensions
which I long ago felt and expressed, but which I had begun to think unfounded,
seem not unlikely to be realised. It is clear that the contest is neither over
nor drawing to a close. Our danger consists in the swarms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> of armed and hostile
natives, and in the climate. The rebels we always beat when we can grapple with
them, but we cannot crush and subdue them. They gather together and assail our
people when a good opportunity presents itself, and when they are repulsed (as
is always the case) their masses are dissolved and scattered abroad, without any
material diminution of their numbers, and ready to assemble and attack any other
vulnerable point, while the British troops are harassed to death by unceasing
pursuits of foes so much more nimble and able to endure the climate than
themselves. This species of warfare must be disheartening and disgusting, and it
involves a consumption of life requiring more reinforcements than we can supply.
All the accounts we receive concur in the insufficiency of the European force
and the necessity of fresh supplies. One letter I saw yesterday talks of 40,000
men being requisite.</p>


<p><i>Petworth, July 31st.</i>&mdash;I came here from Goodwood, not having been here for
twenty years, and am rather glad to see once more a place where I passed so much
of my time in my younger days. I think it is the finest house I have ever seen,
and its collection of pictures is unrivalled for number, beauty, and interest.
Parliament is to be up on Monday, and the Council for the prorogation is to take
place to-day at Osborne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONVERSATION WITH COUNT BRUNNOW.</div>

<p>I met Brunnow at Goodwood, who talked over the political events of the Russian
war, and assured me that the part he had played in it had been much
misrepresented, that he had never been misled by Aberdeen, nor had he ever
misled the Emperor Nicholas, but on the contrary had told him, without any
disguise, the real state of affairs, and the almost certainty that war would
ensue, that he was well aware himself, and had impressed on his master, that
although Aberdeen was most anxious to avoid war, he had no power to do so, and
that though he was nominally Prime Minister, he was destitute of the authority
of one. He said the Emperor was quite sincere in all he had said to Hamilton
Seymour, and if we had had at Petersburg a minister with more tact and
judgement, war would not have taken place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>He (Brunnow) had urged Aberdeen to send Granville there for the purpose, who, he
thinks, would have done very well, and of whom he has a high opinion.</p>


<p><i>London, August 15th.</i>&mdash;I returned to town from Petworth last Monday week, and
on Tuesday a fit of gout came on, which has laid me up ever since, leaving me no
energy to do anything, and least of all to execute the purpose I entertained of
sketching the past session of Parliament, and the curious events which it
evolved; the decline and fall of Palmerston and his Government, the advent of
Derby, and the vicissitudes of his career, deserve a narrative which might, if
well handled by some well-informed writer, be made very interesting: but I am
conscious of my own unfitness and dare not attempt it. It is in truth time for
me to leave off keeping a journal, for by degrees I have lost the habit of
communicating with all the people from whom I have been in the habit of
obtaining political information, and I know nothing worth recording.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD JOHN RUSSELL AND LORD STANLEY.</div>

<p><i>Hinchinbrook, September 5th.</i>&mdash;At The Grove last week, and on Friday to Osborne
for a Council. At the Grove I met Charles Villiers and the Duke of Bedford, and
had much talk with both of them about affairs in general, particularly with the
Duke about Lord John. He is busily employed in concocting a Reform Bill, which
he had probably better leave alone. He seems to have shown his project to
several people, and recently to Aberdeen, who wrote him word that he must take
care not to make it too mild, so much so as to be inconsistent with what he has
before proposed. It seems it is very mild, for it embraces no Schedule A, no
disqualification, though a good deal of addition to the constituency. Lord John
has recently struck up a great intimacy with Lord Stanley, and has had him
repeatedly down to Pembroke Lodge. They take very kindly to each other, and
Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> John is evidently anxious to cultivate him, for he asked the Duke to
invite Stanley to go to Woburn, where Lord John and all his family are gone to
stay. He has been talking a great deal to Stanley on past politics, but not on
present, which would have been rather awkward in their relative positions, but
he has told Stanley a great deal about the political affairs in which he has
been engaged, especially with respect to the great Reform Bill, its history and
incidents, which details no doubt were very interesting and useful to him, and I
am not surprised at Stanley's being much pleased with Lord John's society and
conversation, for Lord John is very agreeable and full of that sort of political
information in which Stanley takes the greatest delight and interest. Although
Lord John has abstained from making any attempt to establish political relations
between them, it is highly probable that he should look forward to the
possibility of some such relations being hereafter established, for in the
present state of parties a fresh organisation and combination is almost
inevitable, and he may very naturally look forward to a combination into which
they may both enter, and with this view he may be very glad to cultivate a
personal and social intimacy, and the Duke thinks he has some such view in his
mind.</p>

<p>The Duke told me that he was at Lord Broughton's the other day, when Broughton
said he had been applied to by some of Palmerston's former followers to make a
representation to Palmerston of the present state of affairs and of the Liberal
party, and to suggest to him the expediency of his abdication of the lead of it,
and the impossibility of that party regaining its ascendency so long as he
insisted on continuing its chief and retaining his pretensions of returning to
office. To this request he sent a refusal. He said he entirely agreed with the
people making it, but that it would have no effect whatever except that of
making a personal quarrel between himself and the Palmerstons, with whom he had
always been on very good terms. I did not learn the names of these Whig
malcontents. Charles Villiers takes a similar view, but does not think that
anything would induce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> Palmerston to retire, or that his former colleagues and
immediate adherents would transfer their support to any one else as long as he
continues to claim it from them. He thinks, moreover, and he has very good means
of judging, that his position and that of John Russell and the impossibility of
their reunion will effectually paralyse the Liberal party and secure the
possession of office to the present Government, and that there is on the whole
rather a preference for the continuation of the present state of things than any
desire for a change which would bring the Whigs back again. He had recently been
with George Lewis, and found him at length rather disposed to come into my view
of the matter of their resignation, and to regret it. It is entirely the opinion
of Charles Villiers himself, and he said there would have been no difficulty in
obtaining from the House of Commons a vote of confidence, for there was no wish
to turn them out, and having administered the rebuke which the Government so
well merited, the majority would have seized with alacrity an occasion to make
it up with them, and to show that they had no desire to quarrel with them
outright.</p>

<p>The Opposition now found all their hopes on the dissensions which they expect to
arise in the Tory Government and camp, which is a very uncertain prospect, and
as to which they are very likely to be disappointed. The day I went to Osborne I
had some conversation with Disraeli, who gave me to understand that he was well
aware the Opposition relied on this contingency, but that it was not likely to
happen. He was aware of Lord Stanley's <i>liaison</i> with Lord John, and it was
evident that the former had made no secret of it, and had told Disraeli that
there was (at present) nothing political in it. Lord John had not said a word
about his Reform Bill to Stanley, and Disraeli knew that he had not. All this
looks like union and confidence between them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE QUEEN AND THE MINISTRY.</div>

<p>As far as outward appearances go, the Queen is on very good terms with them, for
she gave audiences to several of them, and long ones. Her conduct at the time of
the breakup was certainly curious and justifies them in saying that it was by
her express desire that Derby undertook the forma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>tion of the Government. If
Palmerston and his Cabinet were actuated by the motives and expectations which I
ascribe to them, Her Majesty certainly did not play into their hands in that
game. When Derby set before her all the difficulties of his situation, and
entreated her again to reflect upon it, a word from her would have induced him
(without having anything to complain of) to throw it back into Palmerston's
hands. But the word she did speak was decisive as to his going on, and there is
no reason to believe that she was playing a deep game and calculating on his
failure. Nor do I believe that she would herself have liked to see Palmerston
made all powerful. She can hardly have forgotten how inclined he has always been
to abuse his power, and how much she has suffered from his exercise of it, even
when he was to a certain degree under control, and although she seemed to be
quite reconciled to him, and to be anxious for the stability of his Government,
it is difficult to know what her real feelings (or rather those of the Prince)
were, and it is more than probable that her anxiety for the success of
Palmerston's Government was more on account of the members of it whom she
personally likes, and whom she was very reluctant to lose, than out of
partiality for the Premier himself. To Clarendon she is really attached, and
Granville she likes very much; most of the rest she regarded with indifference.</p>


<p><i>London, November 4th.</i>&mdash;Two months have elapsed during which I have felt no
inclination to note down anything in this book, but now that the Newmarket
meetings are at an end, and I must needs think of other things, I shall jot down
the very few things that have come across me in the interval. When I was at
Hillingdon a few weeks ago, I was surprised to hear from Charles Mills a glowing
panegyric on Lord Stanley, who has gained golden opinions and great popularity
at the India House.<a name="FNanchor_1_36" id="FNanchor_1_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_36" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> I was prepared to hear of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span> ability, his indefatigable
industry, and his businesslike qualities; but I was surprised to hear so much of
his courtesy, affability, patience, and candour, that he is neither dictatorial
nor conceited, always ready to listen to other people's opinions and advice, and
never fancying that he knows better than anybody else. I afterwards told
Jonathan Peel what I had heard, and he confirmed the truth of this report, and
said he was the same in the Cabinet; but he made me comprehend his popularity
with the Council by telling me that he espoused all their views and interests,
and co-operated with them in endeavouring to retain certain powers which
belonged to the extinct Court of Directors, but which ought, as a consequence of
the change, to pass into other hands, particularly military appointments and
matters of military control. This received confirmation not long ago from the
Duke of Cambridge, whom I met at Cheveley, and who gave me an account of some
matter in which he had received and executed certain orders from the Secretary
of War, and soon after received a very sharp letter from Stanley calling him to
account for having interfered in what, he said, belonged to the Indian
Secretary. The Duke referred him to the War Office, so that there seems already
a conflict of jurisdiction between the two offices. From all this it is apparent
that we shall have fresh Indian discussions when Parliament meets, and there
will be a necessity for fresh arrangements for the transaction of business. This
may seem to be a very trifling matter, and not worth noticing, but Lord Stanley
is so completely <i>the man</i> of the present day, and in all human probability is
destined to play so important and conspicuous a part in political life, that the
time may come when any details, however minute, of his early career will be
deemed worthy of recollection.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_36" id="Footnote_1_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_36"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [Lord Stanley, the present Earl of Derby, had succeeded to the
Presidency of the Board of Control upon the resignation of Lord Ellenborough,
and was the first Secretary of State for India upon the abolition of the former
office.]</p></div>

<p>I hear the Queen has written a letter to the Prince of Wales announcing to him
his emancipation from parental authority and control, and that it is one of the
most admirable letters that ever were penned. She tells him that he may have
thought the rule they adopted for his education a severe one, but that his
welfare was their only object, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span> well knowing to what seductions of flattery
he would eventually be exposed, they wished to prepare and strengthen his mind
against them, that he was now to consider himself his own master, and that they
should never intrude any advice upon him, although always ready to give it him
whenever he thought fit to seek it. It was a very long letter, all in that tone,
and it seems to have made a profound impression on the Prince, and to have
touched his feelings to the quick. He brought it to Gerald Wellesley in floods
of tears, and the effect it produced is a proof of the wisdom which dictated its
composition.</p>


<div class="sidenote">LORD DERBY'S REFORM BILL.</div>

<p><i>November 17th.</i>&mdash;The principal topics of interest for the last fortnight have
been Bright's speeches, the visit of Palmerston and Clarendon to Compiï¿½gne, the
Portuguese and French quarrel, and the pamphlet and approaching trial of
Montalembert, on all of which there is plenty to say. Bright's speeches have
evidently been a failure, and if they produce any effect, it will probably be
one rather useful to the Government; but the very failure only proves more
strongly the bad policy of Derby in bringing forward a Reform measure, and how
much more safe he would have been if he had let it alone. There is a
considerable though not universal impression that by some means and through the
operation of the chapter of accidents this Reform Bill will prove fatal to him.
Mr. Elwin, the editor of the 'Quarterly Review,' told the Duke of Bedford he
thought so, and that he had been told by a Cabinet Minister that there had been
such serious differences of opinion amongst them on this subject that if the
session had been prolonged the Government would probably have gone to pieces at
that time, and Lord John told the Duke that Walpole had intimated to him
something of the same kind. Lord John is expecting, and Palmerston is hoping,
that the Government will fall, and the latter is still confident that his day
will come again, a confidence which no one else seems to partake of. Clarendon,
who is the staunchest of Palmerston's allies and colleagues, has been
endeavouring to dissipate this illusion and to bring him to take a more accurate
view of his own posi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>tion, but without success. 'He cannot see why John Russell
should not again take office under him,' and it is in vain that Clarendon
assures him that nothing on earth will induce Lord John to do so. Lord John
seems disposed to bide his time, and evidently cherishes a hope and expectation
that the Whig party will return to their allegiance to him and enable him to
form another Government. He seems to have a liking for Bright, though he does
not agree with all his views of Reform. At this moment my own belief is that the
present Government have the best chance in this race for power from the mere
fact of their being in possession, and from the hopeless disunion and confusion
in which the Whigs and Liberals are plunged.</p>

<p>Montalembert's paper is admirable, and I agree with almost every part of it,
especially about the Indian debate and Indian policy, and the causes of
Palmerston's extraordinary fall and the loss of his popularity. His prosecution
by the Imperial Government is either an enormous mistake and political error, or
a stroke of policy so deep and refined as to be beyond my comprehension. Here
everybody regards it as a great imprudence.</p>


<div class="sidenote">PROSECUTION OF COUNT MONTALEMBERT.</div>

<p><i>December 2nd.</i>&mdash;I returned to town yesterday, having been to Badger Hall,
thence to Grimstone, then to Ossington, and yesterday from Hinchinbrook. If I
have written nothing it is not from want of interesting events worth notice, but
because I have known and heard nothing more than all the world learnt from the
newspapers. The chief topics of interest have been the pamphlet and the trial of
Montalembert and the visit of Palmerston and Clarendon to Compiï¿½gne. The first
seems to have excited more interest here than in Paris, where the tyrannical
proceeding was taken very quietly, and little sympathy felt for a man who wrote
so enthusiastically about England, and rebuked his own countrymen, and
particularly his co-religionaries, for their unworthy conduct and language
towards us. There appears to have been a general feeling of regret or
disapproval of the visit to Paris, even on the part of those who are most
friendly to the two Lords. I think it is a pity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> they should have gone just at
this moment, when the Montalembert affair and the Portuguese quarrel have made
the Emperor Napoleon very unpopular here; but it does not seem to me to be a
matter of much consequence, or to be worth the indignation which in some
quarters it has elicited.</p>


<p><i>Hillingdon, December 12th.</i>&mdash;I went to The Grove on Wednesday last and came
back on Friday. There I had long talks with Clarendon for the first time for
many a day, when he told me a great deal that was interesting, just as he used
to do formerly, first about his visit to Compiï¿½gne and his conversations with
the Emperor. The Emperor told him that his motive for prosecuting Montalembert
was that he was aware that there was a conspiracy of literary men, enemies of
his Government, to write it down in a very insidious manner, not by any direct
attacks, but, under the pretence of discussing subjects either not political or
not French, to introduce matter most hostile and most mischievous to him, and
that it was necessary to put down such a conspiracy, and he thought the best
course was to proceed at once against a man so conspicuous as Montalembert, and
to make an example of him, by which others would be deterred. This was his
excuse, whatever its value. It appears to me a very bad one, and I doubt if the
fact itself is true, though Clarendon seemed to think it was. They had a great
deal of conversation about Italy and the anti-Austrian projects attributed to
France, touching which the Emperor's ideas were most strange and extravagant. He
said there had been two questions in which France was interested: one the
regeneration of Poland, the other the regeneration of Italy; that in the pursuit
of the first France naturally became the ally of Austria against Russia, in the
pursuit of the other she became the ally of Russia and Sardinia against Austria;
that the peace with Russia had put an end to anything being done about the
first, and the second alone became possible. Clarendon then pointed out to him
all the difficulties of involving himself in such a contest as this scheme
supposed, that Austria would sacrifice her last florin and her last man in
defence of her Italian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> provinces, that to go to war with her would almost
inevitably sooner or later plunge all Europe into war, and that the object to be
gained by it, even by France herself, would be wholly incommensurate with the
cost and the danger that would be incurred. The Emperor appeared to have no
reply to make to Clarendon's remonstrances, nor did I gather that His Majesty
had any <i>casus belli</i> against Austria, nor even any just cause of complaint to
urge against her, from which I draw the inference not only that his policy is of
a very wild and chimerical character, but that at any moment when he might see,
or think he saw, any advantage in attacking another Power, no consideration of
justice and good faith, still less of moderation and care for the happiness and
peace of the world, would restrain him, and from such a contingency England
would be no more exempt than any other country.<a name="FNanchor_1_37" id="FNanchor_1_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_37" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_37" id="Footnote_1_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_37"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [It is remarkable that this conversation of the Emperor with Lord
Clarendon at Compiï¿½gne took place within a month of the speech to Baron Hï¿½bner
on New Year's Day, which was the signal of war between France and Austria, and
at a time when the secret alliance between the Emperor and M. de Cavour had been
already concluded. The Emperor's object was evidently to delude his English
guests, and Lord Clarendon was partially deceived by him, although he clearly
perceived that there was danger of war ahead.]</p></div>


<p><i>December 12th.</i>&mdash;Another day the Emperor asked Clarendon to come into his room,
when he told him that he wanted his advice, that he was in a great dilemma and
embarrassment in regard to his Roman occupation, and in a false position, from
which he did not know how to extricate himself. He was dying to recall the
French troops and yet unable to do it. He had always hoped to be able to get the
policy laid down in the Edgar Ney letter carried out, but as soon as the Pope
and his ecclesiastical councillors returned to Rome they refused to do anything,
and whenever he held out any threat of withdrawing his troops they always said
he might do so whenever he pleased, for they knew very well the reasons which
prevented his doing it: the moment the French troops marched out there would be
an uprising in Rome and in the Papal States. The religious party in France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
would deeply resent his exposing the Pope to any such danger, and as soon as the
French went away the Austrians would march in and be masters of the whole
country. Clarendon acknowledged the gravity of the situation and the difficulty,
but could suggest no solution of it. They discussed the possibility of inducing
the Pope to relinquish his temporal sovereignty, and to accept a great revenue
instead, but neither of them seems to have thought this plan feasible.</p>


<div class="sidenote">NAPOLEON'S SPEECH TO BARON Hï¿½BNER.</div>

<p><i>January 14th</i>,1859.&mdash;I purposed at the close of the last year to say a few
words about a year which might well be called <i>annus mirabilis</i> and <i>annus
mï¿½stissimus</i> besides, for I do not remember any year marked by a greater number
and variety of remarkable events and occurrences, and certainly none which has
been so fatal to the happiness of so many of our friends. One calamity has
succeeded another with frightful rapidity, till it is difficult to point to any
one who has not sustained some terrible bereavement in the persons of near and
dear relations or intimate friends. A severe fit of gout which attacked me on
Christmas Day, and has kept hold of me ever since, prevented my executing my
purpose, and now I have forgotten all I intended to say, and can only take up
the present condition of affairs as they present themselves at the beginning of
this year, and this is dark and unpromising enough. All Europe has been thrown
into alarm by the speech which the Emperor Napoleon made to the Austrian
Ambassador Hï¿½bner on New Year's Day, and by the announcement which followed it
that Prince Napoleon was going to Turin to marry the King of Sardinia's
daughter. The language of the King of Sardinia in his speech to his Parliament
shortly afterwards confirmed the general apprehensions. The menacing
manifestations having produced their effect, the Emperor seems to have thought
it adviseable to draw in his horns, and to try and calm the effervescence he had
produced. This, however, was not so easy, and in spite of certain tranquillising
articles which the French Press was instructed to put forth, the impression that
mischief is brewing cannot be effaced, and though many think that there will be
no immediate outbreak, and the money dealers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span> and speculators comfort themselves
with thinking that want of money will prevent the great military Powers from
going to war, the best informed persons, and those who are most accustomed to
watch the signs of the times, are convinced that the time is near at hand when
the peace of the world will be broken, that the Emperor is determined upon an
aggression on Austria, and that he is only undecided as to the time when the
operation shall be begun. It is now evident that when our Ex-Ministers were at
Compiï¿½gne, and when the Emperor pretended that he wanted to consult Clarendon
confidentially, he only made a half-confidence of his views and his position,
and that he concealed from Clarendon the important fact of the marriage of
Prince Napoleon, which was arranged at the time.</p>


<p><i>The Grove, January 25th.</i>&mdash;I have passed three days here very agreeably; a
large party on Saturday and Sunday, after which Clarendon, George Lewis, and I,
talking over everything interesting at home and abroad. There has been a good
deal of correspondence between Clarendon and John Russell in a very friendly
spirit, quite different from the terms they have been on till lately, and
indicating the possibility of their coming together again in Opposition and in
office. I saw also some letters of Palmerston's upon foreign affairs,
exceedingly sound and judicious. I am bound to say that all I hear and see of
Palmerston's views, opinions, and conduct is highly creditable to him, and very
different from what I expected. He evinces no impatience to return to office,
and no misconception of his own position. All he writes on foreign affairs, on
France and Austria and Italy, is marked by great wisdom and moderation. He is
taking his proper place as head of the Liberal and Whig party, prepared to go to
Parliament and wait for the development of the policy and measures of the
Government, before forming any plan of a political campaign. Reading at the same
time the letters of Lord John and those of Palmerston on the same subject, that
of foreign policy, I am struck with the great superiority of the latter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD PALMERSTON'S VIEW OF THE ITALIAN WAR.</div>

<p><i>Bretby, January 27th.</i>&mdash;I left The Grove yesterday morn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>ing, and came here
to-day. At breakfast yesterday Clarendon handed over to me a letter from Reeve,
enclosing one from Guizot upon the aspect of affairs in Europe and the chances
of war and peace; an admirable letter, as all his are. Reeve said that he had
been told that Palmerston was likely to give utterance to some sentiments very
anti-Austrian, and in favour of Italian nationality, than which nothing could be
more mischievous or more conducive to the objects of Louis Napoleon. This seemed
to me so inconsistent with the spirit of moderation and good sense which I had
remarked in the letters I had already seen of Palmerston's, that I said I could
not think it possible that he was meditating anything of the sort, and I was
greatly surprised when Clarendon replied, and George Lewis agreed with him, that
nothing was more possible, and that he should not be at all surprised if he
expressed sentiments which were very much those which he had always entertained.
Of course they both deprecated any such language in the strongest manner. When I
got to town I told Reeve what had passed, and he then told me his authority for
what he had written, and that his informant had gathered it from conversations
with Palmerston himself. It was at all events satisfactory to find that the
language of the 'Times' had undergone no alteration, and that they adhered to
the same judicious course and vigorous argumentation which they have all along
adopted. Clarendon and George Lewis are equally afraid of what John Russell may
say, but they are aware that though he may do considerable mischief, his dicta
are infinitely less important than Palmerston's. Granville arrived last night
from Paris and Rome, and I saw him for a few minutes as I was starting to come
here. I had just time to ascertain that his views are identical with those of
Clarendon and George Lewis, and that his efforts will be joined to theirs in
attempting to persuade both Palmerston and John Russell to refrain from saying
anything which may serve as an encouragement to the Emperor, and George Lewis
said that on Palmerston's language in the House of Commons the peace of the
world might possibly depend. There seems no reason to doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> that one of the
things which keeps the Emperor's mind in suspense and uncertainty is his desire
to hear what passes in our Parliament, and to ascertain what amount of sympathy
and support the Italian cause and a war against Austria are likely to find in
this country. Palmerston must have already taken such a measure of the public
feeling here as to know that any appeal to anti-Austrian and pro-Italian
sympathies would meet with no response either in or out of Parliament. The most,
therefore, that he will probably venture to do will be strenuously to recommend
a complete neutrality, and that this country should determine to keep aloof from
any contest that may ensue. This would be playing the Emperor's game, and might
perhaps be more useful to him than any other course we could take, for it would
find pretty general concurrence, and most likely elicit many expressions of
opinions which the Emperor would be able with some plausibility to construe in
the manner most favourable to his own pretensions and designs.</p>


<p><i>January 31st.</i>&mdash;Dined with Lord Salisbury on Saturday at the Sheriffs' dinner,
when I met all the Cabinet, except Malmesbury, Hardwicke, and John Manners.
Derby told me a curious thing. An experiment was made of the possible speed by
which a telegraphic message could be sent and an answer got. They fixed on
Corfu, made every preparation, and sent <i>one word</i>. The message and return were
effected in six seconds. I would not have believed this on any other authority.</p>

<div class="sidenote">UNPOPULARITY OF THE WAR.</div>

<p>Granville is just come from Paris, where he spent a week; he saw and conversed
with everybody, beginning with the Emperor and ending with Thiers. All the
Ministers he talked to, Walewski, Fould, and Rouher, are dead against war, Morny
the same, Baroche said to be for it, and Fleury, who wants to distinguish
himself in the field. The Emperor talked over the whole question and assured him
he had not committed himself to the King of Sardinia, but on the contrary had
told him he would not support him if he committed any imprudence towards
Austria. Granville's impression is that the question is adjourned for the
present, owing to the clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> manifestation in France, but much more to the
unanimous tone of the German and English Press. He is, however, waiting in great
anxiety for the debates in our Parliament, and still hopes for some
anti-Austrian expression which may favour his own views. He has such a contempt
for his own nation and for the opinions of the French people that these last do
not weigh much with him, and he fancies that they may be at any moment changed
and run in a warlike current. Granville thinks our Government have acted
properly throughout these transactions, so far as he can judge.</p>


<p><i>February 5th.</i>&mdash;Parliament opened on Thursday with, as everybody owned, a very
good speech, and the discussions in both Houses were in a very good tone, and
all that could be desired as to foreign policy. It will be impossible for the
Emperor to derive from what passed a single word from any quarter favourable to
his projects. The disappointment of his expectations in this respect may be very
annoying to him, and possibly induce him still to defer his final resolution,
but it is too much to hope that the language of our Parliament will turn him
altogether from his design. Indeed it has now become equally difficult for him
to advance without danger or to retreat without discredit, and in his position
discredit is in itself fraught with danger.</p>


<p><i>February 12th.</i>&mdash;The Emperor Napoleon's speech, looked for with so much anxiety
here, arrived a few hours after its delivery on Monday last, and was on the
whole regarded as rather pacific than the contrary, but still so reserved and
ambiguous that it might mean anything or lead to anything or nothing. The
general opinion seems to be that nothing will take place <i>for the present</i>. The
Government have begun their campaign so quietly, and with so little disturbance
or threatening of any, that if such calm appearances were not often fallacious,
one should predict their passing smoothly through the session; but when one
thinks of this time last year, of the apparent strength and security of
Palmerston's Government, and of the suddenness of his fall, it is impossible to
rely upon the continuance of this unclouded sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>


<p><i>February 19th.</i>&mdash;The general complaint is that nothing is done in Parliament,
and that there is a general apathy, under the continuance of which the
Government gets on without hindrance, while their faults or blunders pass
unchecked. The Chancellor incurred a momentary odium by his attempt at
perpetrating a very shameless job, by making his son-in-law a Judge in Lunacy
without having any qualifications for such an office; but after a little spurt
in the House of Commons, the result of which was the appointment being
rescinded, the matter quietly dropped. Gladstone's extravagant proceedings at
Corfu<a name="FNanchor_1_38" id="FNanchor_1_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_38" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> have elicited something like an attack led on by Lord Grey, but
although this subject will probably be more seriously and warmly discussed after
he comes home, it does not seem likely to lead to much at present, and Derby
will probably parry Grey's attack on Monday next.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_38" id="Footnote_1_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_38"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [Mr. Gladstone had accepted, temporarily, the office of Lord High
Commissioner of the Ionian Islands, under Lord Derby's Government. His
proceedings there excited great surprise in England. The eventual result of his
mission was the surrender of the Protectorate of the Ionian Islands to the
Kingdom of Greece.]</p></div>


<div class="sidenote">LORD COWLEY'S MISSION TO VIENNA.</div>

<p><i>February 27th.</i>&mdash;Derby prevailed on Grey to defer his Ionian motion till
Gladstone's return, which he said would be in a fortnight at least. Palmerston
had given notice of his intention to call the attention of the House of Commons
to the present state of Europe, and to ask if the Government could give the
country any information on the subject. The Government tried to persuade him to
defer his intention, but without effect, and he persisted in his course. In the
meanwhile Cowley suddenly arrived in England, sent for by the Government, as it
was said, for the purpose of receiving instructions in respect to the
conferences expected at Paris on the Danubian affairs. On Thursday morning the
world was electrified at reading an article in the 'Times' stating that Cowley
was going on a special mission to Vienna for the purpose of making matters up,
if possible, between France and Austria. The day before I had been apprised of
the fact by Granville, who had heard it from Clarendon, to whom Cowley had
imparted the secret of his mission. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span> mission was in fact rather one from the
Emperor than from our Government, who had really done nothing whatever, but were
too happy to allow Cowley to go and try his hand in patching matters up. He has
done it all off his own bat. Seeing how day after day war appeared to be
becoming more imminent, he resolved to see if he could not do something to
arrest the evil; he found the French Ministers quite agreed with him, and the
Emperor in a state of mingled rage, disappointment, and perplexity, clinging
with his characteristic tenacity to the designs on which his mind has been so
long fixed, and to which he probably stands committed more than we are aware of,
by his own professions, and by his cousin, who no doubt gave Cavour to
understand he might certainly count upon the Emperor's aid. This course also he
is the more reluctant to abandon, as he has certainly persuaded himself, or has
been persuaded by others, that in no other way can he secure himself from the
attempts of Italian conspirators and assassins, so that it is personal fear
which is the real ground of what is called his policy. On the other hand, he is
intensely disgusted and enraged at finding the whole feeling and opinion of
England so decidedly pronounced against him, and that in no quarter whatever,
neither in Parliament nor the Press, which represents the mind of the whole
country, nor in any public men, can he find the slightest sympathy or
encouragment, or anything but the most indignant disapprobation.<a name="FNanchor_1_39" id="FNanchor_1_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_39" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_39" id="Footnote_1_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_39"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [The war of 1859 is now judged of more favourably than it was at the
time of its inception, and the result obtained&mdash;the independence and unification
of Italy&mdash;has led men to condone the tortuous and deceitful policy by which it
was arrived at. The object of M. de Cavour was a noble one, although the means
he employed were unscrupulous. The chief motive of the Emperor Napoleon was the
fear of his old allies the Carbonari. Orsini's attempt on his life had
powerfully affected him.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>The sentiment of England is if possible still stronger in the same sense in
Germany, and it is universal in France, where it is only prevented from
manifesting itself with as much force and vivacity as in Germany and here by the
fettered and subservient condition of the Press. In addition to this I am
informed that the project of war is not popular with the army itself; and as it
is not morally certain that by plunging into war the Emperor will be secure from
the danger of assassination, and there is at least as good a chance of war
bringing with it perils of another sort quite as formidable, so his very
selfishness makes him doubt and waver, and inclines him to listen to the
remonstrances which are addressed to him. Upon this uncertain and varying state
of mind Cowley has been endeavouring to work, and he has so far succeeded as to
have been entrusted by the Emperor with a commission to go to Vienna and
negotiate with the Austrian Government a settlement of their differences, or
rather, as there are in fact no differences to settle, to obtain from the
Austrian Government some concessions by virtue of which he may be enabled to
withdraw from his present false position without discredit, by which means he
may give satisfaction to France and Europe, though at the risk of disappointing
Sardinia and exasperating the Italian Carbonari.</p>

<p>When Palmerston's discussion came on upon Friday last, it was already known
(through the 'Times') that Cowley was going to Vienna, though he himself had
told nobody of this expedition (except Clarendon), and he evidently did not mean
it should have been proclaimed. On Friday, Disraeli and Malmesbury said nothing
of Cowley's mission, but they both announced that the Papal territories would be
evacuated by the French and Austrian troops, and the public inferred that this
evacuation was going to take place by a mutual agreement, and everybody asked,
'Why then is Cowley going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> to Vienna?' but the truth was that the Pope had
requested the two Governments to withdraw their troops, and one of Cowley's
objects is to procure the assent of Austria to that withdrawal, France having no
doubt agreed to it on certain conditions, of which I do not know the details,
but which are committed to the management of Cowley. Clarendon seemed to think
that there was no more danger <i>now</i> of the pacific purpose of Cowley being
obstructed at Vienna than at Paris, for he said that the Austrians are so proud,
and moreover so greatly incensed at the conduct of France, that it is very
doubtful whether they will be induced to make any concessions at all, and
whether the Emperor of Austria will not prefer to encounter all the danger of
war, prepared as he is, than consent to anything which should have the
appearance of humbling himself before the outrageous pretences and intolerable
insolence of the Emperor of the French.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. WALPOLE AND MR. HENLEY RESIGN.</div>

<p>In the midst of the absorbing interest of this great question, the Government
Reform Bill is coming on. They appear to have thought it adviseable to bespeak
the good word of the 'Times,' and accordingly they sent Delane a copy of their
Bill. This morning the heads of it appear in the 'Times' with an approving
article. Mild as it appears to be, it is too strong for Walpole and Henley, who
have resigned, but why they did not resign before it is difficult to understand.
At Kent House yesterday afternoon there was a little gathering of Clarendon,
Charles Wood, and George Lewis, when they all agreed that if the Government
measure was such a one as they could possibly support, their proper policy would
be to assist the Government in carrying it.</p>

<p>To English statesmen of all parties (with one or two exceptions) it was apparent
that the declaration of war by France on Austria was the destruction of the
great compact of 1815, which (whatever may have been its defects) had given
forty-four years of peace to the Continent of Europe, and which had survived the
Revolution of 1848 and the Crimean contest of 1854. It was the first outbreak of
the military power of the French Empire and it was likely to lead to future
wars, as the result has proved. The defeat of Austria and the dissolution of the
Germanic Confederation in 1866 was the result of the combined action of Prussia
and Italy, north and south of the Alps; and the Franco-German War of 1870 was
the result of the military ascendency Prussia had thus acquired in Europe. The
policy of England was simply based on the principle that the duration of peace
depended on the maintenance of the existing territorial arrangements of Europe.]</p>


<p><i>March 1st.</i>&mdash;According to all political calculations Cowley's mission ought to
succeed, but I feel no confidence in his success, and rather believe that the
Emperor Napoleon is acting with his usual duplicity and treachery, and duping
Cowley to gain time, which is necessary to his plans.<a name="FNanchor_1_40" id="FNanchor_1_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_40" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> revolting to see
that the peace of the world and so much of the happiness or misery of mankind
depend upon the caprice and will and the selfish objects and motives of a
worthless upstart and adventurer, who is destitute of every principle of honour,
good faith, or humanity, but who is unfortunately invested with an enormous
power for good or evil. And this is the end of fifty years of incessant
movement, of the progress of society, of the activity and development of the
human intellect in the country which is eternally mouthing about its superior
civilisation and its mission to extend the benefits of that civilisation over
the whole world.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_40" id="Footnote_1_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_40"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [This was the fact. It was not known until long afterwards that
positive engagements had been entered into at Plombiï¿½res between the Emperor and
M. de Cavour in the preceding autumn, including the marriage of Prince Napoleon
to the daughter of the King of Sardinia, and the cession of Savoy and Nice as a
compensation for the conquest of Northern Italy. Cavour had the Emperor in his
power, and threatened, if he drew back, to publish the correspondence.]</p></div>

<p>Disraeli brought forward his Reform Bill last night in a well-set speech, only
too elaborate. It was coolly received, except by its most angry opponents, who
lost no time in denouncing it.</p>


<div class="sidenote">THE GOVERNMENT REFORM BILL.</div>

<p><i>March 3rd.</i>&mdash;It would be difficult to say what the feeling of the House of
Commons really is on the subject of the Government Reform Bill. The night it
came out everybody who spoke spoke against it. The Ultra-Reformers, from Bright
down to John Russell, naturally express nothing but abhorrence and contempt for
such a measure; half-and-half Reformers, who consider Reform a necessity, and
who would be glad to have the question settled for the present on such easy
terms, do not venture to say much in its favour; and the Whigs generally,
particularly at their head-quarters, Brooks's, discuss with much variety of
opinion whether the second reading ought to be resisted or not, the prevailing
opinion being that the principle of the Bill (which is the equalisation of town
and county franchise) is so inadmissible that it ought to be rejected, and they
come to that conclusion the more readily because they think its rejection in
that stage would put an end to the Government. On the other hand, Derby brought
together two hundred of his supporters the day after the Bill appeared, and
obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span> their assent to it, and an engagement to support it. The resignations
of Henley and Walpole have been prejudicial to the Government. Their
explanations, which were full of half-suppressed bitterness towards their
colleagues, were considered damaging, and to have revealed trickery on the part
of Derby, though they seem to me to have rather exhibited weakness on the part
of the retiring Ministers. But what they have clearly shown is the extreme
penury of the party in point of intellectual resources, when they can find no
man of any weight or reputation to fill up the vacancies. But if the Government
is weak, and their position very precarious, the state of the Opposition is at
least as deplorable, for there is no union or agreement amongst them, and
Granville acknowledged to me last night that if Derby should fall on the second
reading, and Palmerston be sent for, as it may be expected he would be, by the
Queen, that it is impossible to see how another Government could be formed. This
state of affairs and the magnitude of the embarrassment will probably at last
make some of those who so obstinately insisted upon their being right in
resigning last year after the Vote of Censure, begin to think that they would
have done better to accept the rebuke and stay in. All that is now occurring
serves to confirm my own opinion upon that point.</p>

<p>Since Cowley's arrival at Vienna nothing has been heard of his mission, but
there is nothing apparent tending to lead to the conclusion that he has been
able to do any good, and the general impression is that the Emperor Napoleon is
only endeavouring to gain time, and making a tool of Cowley in hopes of thereby
committing this country in some degree to his ulterior designs, and there are
not wanting persons who believe that it will after all be against this country
that his arms will be turned, and not against Austria.</p>


<p><i>March 8th.</i>&mdash;On Saturday morning the 'Times' published the article in the
'Moniteur' (evidently the Emperor's composition), in which a formal denial was
given to the imputed warlike intentions of France. The general impression
produced by this manifesto was that the Emperor had at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> been diverted from
his purpose by the various manifestations which he had seen at home as well as
abroad, and that he had resolved to abandon it altogether. Many, however,
refused to believe in this happy result, and thought that he was only trying to
throw dust in the eyes of the world, and endeavouring to gain time. All things
considered, I incline to believe that he has resolved to postpone his warlike
designs <i>sine die</i>, though retaining his wish to employ the vast means on which
he has expended so much money, and looking forward to some pretext which the
chapter of accidents may afford him to execute his purpose.</p>

<p>Strenuous efforts are making to bring about an understanding and agreement
between the Whig leaders as to opposing the Government Bill, in which nobody is
so active as George Lewis, who being very intimate with John Russell, and much
in his confidence, and at the same time still on a footing of an adherent of
Palmerston, is better qualified than any one to form a link between the two and
to produce a mutual accord. John Russell has drawn up certain Resolutions which
he intends to move on the second reading. These Resolutions have been shown to
George Grey and to Palmerston, who have agreed to support them, and it may be
presumed that if all the Whig leaders, or even most of them, take this course,
they will be followed by the majority of the rank and file. The Government and
their friends are considerably alarmed at this hostile demonstration, and the
more disappointed because they had been led to believe that Palmerston intended
to support the second reading, and they knew that many moderate Whigs were
inclined to take the same course. Some may do so still, but if the rival leaders
can agree upon an attack on the Bill, though they may be agreed on nothing else,
it is certainly probable that the Government will be beaten. Then will come the
question of dissolution or resignation. This will probably depend on the amount
and composition of the majority, and it will be a knotty point for Derby to
decide upon.</p>


<div class="sidenote">OPPOSITION TO THE REFORM BILL.</div>

<p><i>Savernake, March 9th.</i>&mdash;I met George Lewis at the Athenï¿½um yesterday, and had a
talk about the state of affairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> here. He told me that the whole Liberal party,
he believed, would support John Russell's Resolutions. There had been
considerable doubt at first whether the second reading of the Bill should be
opposed or not, but upon a close examination of the Bill they found that it was
such a dishonest measure that it could not be allowed to pass, and therefore it
was better to throw it out at once. Palmerston and Lord John are now on very
good terms. Lord John had sent his Resolutions to Palmerston, and Palmerston had
sent him word he would support whatever he proposed. Lewis thinks, though there
is no agreement between them further than this with regard to the Reform Bill,
that if this Government falls, and the Whigs return to power, means will be
found of adjusting the rival pretensions of the two leaders, and getting them to
act together. To effect this, his reliance is mainly on the Queen, who he thinks
may and will exert her influence and authority for this end. There is, however,
a notion abroad that if John Russell persists in his Resolutions, the Government
will withdraw the first clause, which is tantamount to withdrawing the Bill
itself. Lewis believes in this intention, and that if they do it they will
become so unpopular, and incur so much discredit, that it will be impossible for
them to go on or to attempt a dissolution. Another notion is that they will
withdraw the Bill, and endeavour to go on without any Bill at all, trusting to
the Opposition not daring to propose a vote of want of confidence, which it is
very doubtful if they could carry. The only thing clear is that they are very
anxious to turn the Government out, and to take their chance of the
consequences. Their success seems not at all unlikely, but when they have
accomplished their object their embarrassments will begin. First there will be
Lord John and Palmerston, then <i>l'embarras des richesses</i> of the numerous
candidates for office, and settling who is to come in and who are to be thrown
overboard.</p>


<p><i>March 15th.</i>&mdash;Cowley arrived from Vienna on Saturday. I have not yet seen him,
but Clarendon told me yesterday that he brings back the most satisfactory
assurances on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> the part of Austria, who is ready to give every pledge of her
pacific intentions, and to come to any agreement with France upon the withdrawal
of both their forces from the Papal States, but that she will make no
concessions inconsistent with her rights and her dignity, or which could seem to
damp the enthusiasm now prevailing in Germany in her favour; in fact, that she
has no concessions to make. Within the last few days the symptoms from France
have been more menacing. At Paris the conviction is general that war is meant,
and I am obliged to believe it likewise. The resignation of Prince Napoleon
seems to have been a mere sham, and his intimacy with the Emperor as close as
ever. There is no reason to believe that the military preparations in France are
suspended, and in Piedmont they are certainly going on actively.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD JOHN RUSSELL'S RESOLUTIONS.</div>

<p>The other great topic of interest, viz. the Reform Bill and John Russell's
Resolutions, does not look in a more satisfactory state. While many sensible
people deprecate this move of John Russell's, and lament that Palmerston should
have consented to support it, the probability seems that it will be carried, but
the greatest uncertainty prevails as to the course which the Government will
adopt, and whether they will try to go on, dropping their Bill altogether, or
continue the fight with its remaining clauses, or whether they will take the
chance of a dissolution. It is now clear enough that Derby made a great blunder
in undertaking to deal with the question of Reform at all, and that a consistent
Conservative course would have been the most honourable and the wisest, and have
afforded him the best chance of staying in office. By bringing forward a measure
to the principle of which it is well known that he and his whole Government and
party are in their hearts adverse, and then trying to vitiate the principle by
certain contrivances in the details, by which the scruples of his own party may
be obviated, he exposes himself to the charge of producing a dishonest measure,
and this is what the Whigs urge as their ground for attacking it in front and at
once. This is what Lewis said to me, 'We are bound to defeat a measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span> which is
so dishonest that it is not susceptible of such improvement in Committee as
would warrant our passing it.' The conduct of the Whigs, however, is not a whit
more honest. Their allegation is a mere pretext, and their real motive is that
they think they see their way back to office through an attack upon the
Government Bill; they are indifferent to the consequences, and all they want is
to get the coast clear for themselves, and take the chance of settling the
difficult questions which will arise as to the formation of a Government and the
conditions on which it can be formed. All this appears to me quite as dishonest
as anything the Government have done or are doing. Palmerston never was a
Reformer. He was opposed as much as he dared and could be even to the great
measure of 1832, which all the world was for. When he brought forward a measure
of his own two or three years ago, he did it without sincerity or conviction,
and merely for a party object, and now he is uniting with John Russell without
any real agreement with him in opinion, and with full knowledge that if they
succeed and climb into office on the ruins of the Government Bill he will be
obliged to propose a measure much stronger than he believes to be either
necessary or safe. Believing that Palmerston and John Russell were agreed no
further than upon the Resolutions on Monday next, I thought that a difference
must arise between them (in the event of their coming into office) on the Reform
Bill they should produce, but I was told just now that upon this point they are
already nearly if not completely agreed. They are, however, not yet agreed upon
the great question of the Premiership, or which of them shall go to the House of
Lords. The impatience and confidence of Lord John seems to be unbounded, and in
spite of his being the younger by seven years, his eagerness to be in office
again much more intense than that of Palmerston. Although this is such a
miserable Government, both discreditable and incompetent, and it is a misfortune
to have the country ruled by such men, I cannot desire the success of such
selfish and unpatriotic man&oelig;uvres as those by which the Whigs are
en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>deavouring to supplant them, and consequently I regard the whole state of
affairs with indescribable disgust and no small apprehension. I believe the
country to be in nearly equal danger from Louis Napoleon abroad and Mr. Bright
at home, and I fear that there is no capacity in the Government to cope with the
one, and no such amount of wisdom and patriotism amongst the chief men of all
parties as is requisite to defeat the designs of the other.</p>


<p><i>March 16th.</i>&mdash;Cowley called on me yesterday at the Council Office. He said that
he had never believed there would be war, and he did not expect it now; that all
the agitation and turmoil that had been vexing Europe for the last three months
were to be attributed to the conduct of Cavour and his attempts to drag France
into assisting Piedmont in her aggressive policy, and to misunderstandings which
had been produced by the strange conduct of the French Government, the imprudent
speech of the Emperor to Hï¿½bner on January 1st, and the ambiguous manifestations
which had followed it. To comprehend all these things it was necessary to be
acquainted with the whole course of Cavour's policy and his dealings with
France, and to understand the peculiar character of the Emperor and the motives
and impulses by which he is actuated. When Austria refused to join England and
France in the Russian War, Cavour thought that an opportunity presented itself
of which he might take advantage, and which would lead to a realisation of his
views for the aggrandisement of Piedmont, and he offered to join the alliance
and send an army to the Crimea. This offer (as Cowley thinks very imprudently
and unfortunately) was accepted. He thinks it was unwise, because the assistance
of Piedmont was not required, and could not have any material effect on the
result of the contest, while it was sure to excite hopes and expectations, and
to give rise to demands which would be afterwards found very inconvenient and
embarrassing. Accordingly Cavour took the earliest opportunity of expressing his
hopes that when peace should return Sardinia and her services would not be
overlooked. General expressions of goodwill were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> given, but Cowley cannot
answer for what more the Emperor may have said.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD COWLEY'S VIENNA NEGOTIATION.</div>

<p>His account of his mission does not quite correspond with what I had before
heard of it, and is an additional proof of the difficulty of arriving at truth.
He told me that he had written to Malmesbury and told him he thought it very
expedient to send somebody to Vienna to talk to Buol and the Emperor, and to try
and mediate between Austria and France, to which Malmesbury had replied he had
better go himself, as nobody else would be so likely to effect the object. The
consent of Buol having been previously obtained, he proposed it at Paris, where
his services were gladly accepted. He had already spoken very openly to the
Emperor, and told him very plain truths as to his position and his conduct, and
when he went he told His Majesty without disguise what his intentions were and
his wishes, and what he desired that Austria should do. The Emperor was very
frank, totally disdained any wish to make war, but said he should like Austria
to do certain things, which amounted to full security for Piedmont and
renunciation of any unfair and unjustifiable predominance in Italy. He found
them at Vienna more angry than alarmed; suspicious, but not unreasonable; their
military condition so good and powerful that, believing France really bent on
attacking them, there was a very general feeling that it was better war should
come at once than have it indefinitely hanging over them, and at first it seemed
unlikely that they would return any conciliatory assurances which he might carry
back to France. At last, however, he got them to say what he thought was as much
as could be expected from them, and what ought to satisfy the French Government.
Since he left Paris (now three weeks ago or more) he has not had a line from
thence, and he is wholly ignorant of the march of affairs during his absence;
but he hopes and expects to find a pacific disposition, and his object is to
prevail on the Emperor to put an end to the general state of uncertainty and
alarm by announcing to Sardinia that she is in no danger from Austria, and that
therefore no assistance from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> France will be necessary, and she may safely
desist from her warlike preparations. This is in fact the only way by which the
crisis can be put an end to, and if the Emperor really has been sincere in his
professions and means to make his acts correspond with them, he will forthwith
put forward some clear and unambiguous declaration, and some definite
communication to Piedmont which will leave no room for doubt or suspicion, and
restore confidence and tranquillity to Europe again.</p>


<p><i>March 22nd.</i>&mdash;Yesterday the 'Times' announced that a Congress had been agreed
upon, which was believed, so the funds rose and there was a general belief that
a solution was at hand, but it turns out not to be true. The Emperor wishes for
one as a means by which he may back out of his scrape, which Cowley writes is
now his object, but it is impossible to believe that Austria will listen to it,
and Clarendon thinks that she would do wrong to consent to it, and that we
should get into a scrape by being a party to it, as no reliance whatever can be
placed on the good faith or honesty of France, who would deceive us and Austria,
as she has often done before.</p>

<p>Yesterday the Neapolitan exiles arrived at an hotel in Dover Street in several
hack cabs, decorated with laurels, and preceded by a band of music. I did not
see the men, but saw the empty cabs; there was no crowd.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more uninteresting than the first evening of the debate on John
Russell's Resolutions last night. Lord March told me in the morning that the
Government would certainly dissolve as soon as the Resolutions were carried.
Every day makes the folly of Derby more apparent in bringing in any Reform Bill
at all.</p>


<div class="sidenote">DEBATE ON REFORM BILL</div>

<p><i>March 24th.</i>&mdash;When I think of the Reform Bill of 1832, and compare the state of
affairs at that time with that of the present time, nothing can be more
extraordinary. Then the interest was intense, the whole country in a fever of
excitement, the Press rabid, the clamour for Reform all but universal, party
running tremendously high, no doubt or hesitation about individual wishes and
opinions, and each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span> camp perfectly united in itself, and full of energy and
zeal. In this condition of the public mind and of politics the debates began and
continued. This debate has begun and seems likely to continue, how differently!
There are neither zeal nor union on one side or the other, everybody is
dissatisfied with the state of affairs, and nobody can see a satisfactory issue
from the general embarrassment. There have been two nights of debate, and as yet
all the speaking has been one way, all on the anti-Reform side. John Russell was
flat, and Stanley, who replied to him, actually read his speech, which, though
it was much complimented by his own friends, seems to have been far from
effective. Horsman made a very good speech the first night, and Bulwer Lytton
spoke with great eloquence and effect on Tuesday, far better than anybody
thought he could speak, and the Solicitor-General made a magnificent speech, in
which he attacked John Russell with great vigour and complete success. The only
tolerable speech on the Opposition side was Sidney Herbert's. Nobody has the
least idea what course the Government will take of the three open to them,
whether they will resign, dissolve, or go on with the second reading. The
inference from Stanley's speech was that they will dissolve, but Lytton and
Cairns seemed anxious to do away with the impression that speech had made, and
one is led to infer from what they said that the Government will most likely
proceed to the second reading, which would probably be their wisest and
certainly their most popular course. The majority of those who are going to vote
for the Resolutions do so unwillingly, and would have preferred going into
Committee, or to have fought the battle on the second reading. As it is, if
Government do not throw up their cards, the second reading is in my opinion sure
to pass, and not improbably the Bill itself with great alterations.</p>

<p>The state of foreign affairs is as uncertain as ever. So incurable is the
distrust of the Emperor Napoleon that the greatest doubts prevail whether he
means peace or war, and whether even this Congress which he is trying to bring
about is not a mere dodge for the purpose of gaining time, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span> order to
extract out of it a plausible case for a complete breach with Austria.</p>

<p>Gladstone is come back from Italy completely duped by Cavour, who has persuaded
him that Piedmont has no ambition or aggressive objects, and that Austria alone
is guilty of all the trouble in which the world has been plunged. He told this
to Aberdeen, who treated his delusions and his credulity with the utmost scorn
and contempt, but he is said to have found John Russell more credulous, and
ready to accept Gladstone's convictions.</p>


<p><i>March 26th.</i>&mdash;The debate goes on, to the intense disgust of everybody, though
enlivened by a few clever and telling speeches. But everybody is disgusted with
the whole affair, from which all see that no good can come, and probably much
mischief will ensue. The Government side continues to have the best of the
debate, Horsman, who spoke for them, and Lytton and Cairns having been very
superior to all the speakers on the other side. On Friday Palmerston spoke, with
great vigour, but not much effect. His speech was very jaunty, but very
insincere. When he said that he cordially supported the Resolutions of his noble
friend, everybody knew that it was not true, that he really disapproved of them
and that he only consented to go with Lord John in order to evince his
willingness to make up their political difference, and to lend himself to the
reunion of all the Whig party; but in his speech he said enough to show that
there is not likely to be an entire or lasting agreement between them, and that
the two Kings of Brentford will not long continue to smell at the same nosegay.
The Opposition have been all along quite confident of victory on the
Resolutions, and it has been impossible to make sure of the intentions of the
Government in the event of their being beaten, as they have severally held such
very different language on the point.</p>

<p>But an incident has occurred which is very likely to extricate the Government
from their difficulty, and of which I presume they will avail themselves. Owen
Stanley (brother of Stanley of Alderley) the other night blurted out, without
previous concert with anybody, a notice of a motion of want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span> of confidence in
the event of the second reading not passing. The Opposition are unanimously
disgusted at this piece of folly and meddling, while the Government are of
course delighted at such a plank of safety being held out to them, and if they
use it dexterously, they may completely defeat Lord John and Palmerston, and
prolong their own tenure of office for some time at least.</p>


<div class="sidenote">DEFEAT OF THE MINISTRY</div>

<p><i>April 1st.</i>&mdash;The great debate came to an end last night. The majority was
greater than either side expected, and the Government and their friends were
sanguine to the last that they should win by a few votes.<a name="FNanchor_1_41" id="FNanchor_1_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_41" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Although there was
a great deal of tedious speaking, it was on the whole a very able and creditable
debate, and there were several very powerful speeches, but principally on the
side of the minority. Gladstone's was particularly good, and Dizzy's reply, with
a very effective philippic against John Russell, was exceedingly clever, and
delivered with much dignity and in very good taste. Although the question of
Reform was regarded with so much indifference, as the debate proceeded and party
spirit and emulation waxed hot, the interest and curiosity became intense. They
have become still more intense to-day, and the town is in a state of feverish
anxiety to know what is going to happen, and, as usual on such occasions, there
are a thousand reports, speculations, and guesses afloat. This morning the
prevalent idea was that they would resign, but this evening, and since Derby's
brief notice in the House of Lords, it is rather that they will dissolve.
Certainly the Queen might very well refuse her consent to a dissolution if
proposed to her, and this would of course compel the Government to resign; but
nobody knows whether she wishes Derby to stay in, or would prefer to take the
chance of forming another Ministry. I have no idea that happen what may she will
send for Lord John Russell; but no doubt she knows all that has recently passed
between him and Palmerston, and about the formation of another Government, and
it is not impossible that she may shrink from being plunged into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
difficulties which would attend the attempts to form a Government in which they
were to divide the power and authority between them.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_41" id="Footnote_1_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_41"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [The numbers were: for the second reading of the Bill 291, for Lord
John Russell's Resolutions 330; majority against the Government 39.]</p></div>


<p><i>April 4th.</i>&mdash;The report yesterday was that Derby does not mean to resign or
dissolve, or to go on with the present Bill, but perhaps bring in a fresh one.
As we shall hear it all this evening, it is useless to speculate on the subject.
The Opposition are evidently puzzled what to do. I went to Kent House, where
Lewis said the Government were much mistaken if they imagined they should be
left alone; he did not know what would be done, but certainly they must look to
be attacked in some shape or other. Granville in the evening took the opposite
line, and said the best party game would be to let them alone. Nothing, however,
will ever induce John Russell to keep quiet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">M. DE CAVOUR'S POLICY</div>

<p>Clarendon came in, and we talked of foreign affairs. He thinks war inevitable,
and that the French are only gaining time to complete their preparations. I said
I thought Cowley had been duped by the Emperor, but he thought not. Cowley had
all along seen all the objections to the proposed Congress and suspected the
<i>arriï¿½re pensï¿½e</i> of it, but said it was impossible when proposed to object to
it, as the Emperor would put forward such a refusal as a pretext, and say that
it would have prevented war. Two years ago he had a reliance upon the Emperor
which he had no longer; that he was completely changed now from what he was, and
it was difficult to know what he really meant, and when he was sincere or the
reverse. Clarendon told us he had lately seen Marliani, an old acquaintance of
his, a Spanish Liberal and friend of Cavour's. Marliani said that the Italian
question was ill understood in England, and he had come over for the express
purpose of seeing Clarendon and talking it over with him, and putting before him
a paper he had written upon it. The conversation was curious. Clarendon told him
he was quite mistaken if he thought the Government or any other Government could
take any part at variance with the existing treaties, or that the country would
allow them to do so, even if inclined. He then asked him what his friend Cavour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
meant to do in the dilemma in which he had got himself and his country, and
expressed very strong opinions on his conduct. Marliani replied that it was not
quite just to censure Cavour with such severity, and without considering his
position, that during his whole life his most ardent desire and fixed idea was
that of purging Italy of the Austrians and aggrandising his own country, and now
when he saw before him the probable realisation of his fond hopes, that he was
backed up and encouraged by the master of 300,000 men in the game he was
playing, and taught to rely upon that aid, could it be wondered at that he
should yield to the seduction? Clarendon asked what would happen if the Emperor
proved faithless to him, as he had done to others, and in what position Cavour
would find himself. Marliani replied that he had no hesitation in telling him
what he thought need not be a secret, at least to him, as he was sure Cavour
would tell Clarendon himself if he saw him, and that Cavour had fully made up
his mind what to do. If the Emperor ended by throwing over the Italian cause and
refused to go to war, Cavour would resign, the King would abdicate, and the
whole correspondence with all the Emperor's letters (of which they had an
immense number) would be published and circulated over all Europe to show the
baseness and perfidy of the man in whom they had trusted, and to force him to
hide his head from the indignation and contempt of the world. Everything
indicates that, whether from fear of this vindictive explosion or because he
thinks it his policy, he is hastening his preparations, has renewed his
engagements to Cavour, and that he means to go to war as soon as he can.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT.</div>

<p><i>April 7th</i>, 1859.&mdash;The determination of the Government, announced in both
Houses on Monday evening, took the world by surprise. Nobody thought there would
be a dissolution. Derby's speech was very bad, much below his usual level. The
attack on John Russell which formed a chief part of it was merely a <i>rï¿½chauffï¿½</i>
of that of Disraeli, but very inferior to it in every respect. Disraeli in the
other House spoke much better, and with more taste and temper. The Opposition
leaders are evidently much taken aback; the Derbyites assert that they have
reason to expect a gain of forty votes, but nobody believes it. Many think a
much more Radical and an angry Parliament will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> returned, but there is no
excitement, and it seems to me more probable that those are right who think the
relative proportions will not be materially altered. The Whig chiefs are very
angry with John Russell for committing himself as he did on Monday night by his
speech and announcement of his own plan of Reform. Great attempts were made to
dissuade him from doing this, but he would not listen to reason. Palmerston made
a speech clearly indicative of disagreement with Lord John, though with a
semblance of union. The Resolutions on one side and the Dissolution on the other
have both been great faults, of which the mischievous consequences may be very
serious, but which cannot be made manifest till we see the result of the
election.</p>


<p><i>April 15th.</i>&mdash;I have been reading over to George Lewis my account of what took
place about the Reform Bill of 1832, to assist him in reviewing that period of
history, and in so doing it is impossible not to be struck with the contrast
between the public excitement which prevailed then and the apathy and absence of
interest which we witness now. At every general election there is a great deal
of bustle, activity, party zeal, and contention, but there are not more of these
now than on ordinary occasions, if anything less. Both parties are confident
that they shall gain, and the Derbyites are making great efforts, and have
collected a very large sum of money. Derby has given 20,000<i>l.</i> to the fund, but
candidates are slack in coming forward with the prospect of the new Parliament
not lasting many months. The question of peace or war is still in abeyance, but
inclines rather towards war; the public securities oscillate like a barometer,
and people are puzzled and unable to form any opinion.</p>


<p><i>April 20th.</i>&mdash;The long promised statements were made in both Houses on Monday
night, but they told us nothing that was not already known, and merely expressed
hopes that war might still be averted. Disraeli in the Commons was more sanguine
than Malmesbury and Derby in the Lords. Clarendon and Derby both made excellent
speeches, the former particularly; all he said was sound and true. The most
striking thing in both Houses was the extreme caution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span> and reserve of the
speakers on both sides, and particularly their reticence and forbearance about
France. Not one word of blame of the Emperor of the French; no more about him,
his sayings and doings, than about the Emperor of Russia, or than if he had had
nothing whatever to do with the present state of things. This was probably
politic, but it was lamentable and disgraceful that we should be obliged, or
think ourselves obliged, to abstain from speaking the truth, for fear of
offending this rascally adventurer, who by the egregious folly and cowardice of
the French nation has been invested with such an awful power of mischief, and
whom neither fear nor shame deters from pursuing his own wicked ends at the
expense of any amount of misery and desolation which he may inflict upon
mankind. One cannot help contrasting the extreme delicacy and forbearance
exhibited towards him with the violence and abuse which were directed against
the Emperor Nicholas in 1854.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. DISRAELI'S EXPECTATIONS.</div>

<p>I met Disraeli yesterday afternoon, when he told me they had got such
satisfactory news from the Continent that he considered the affair as virtually
settled and the danger at an end. God grant it may be so, but I am far from
being satisfied that the danger is over. On the eve of great resolutions, and as
the moment of taking an irrevocable step draws near, the actors in great events
have generally some misgivings, and pause upon the brink, and so probably will
these quasi-belligerents do now; but I believe the concessions which France
expresses herself willing to make to our entreaties to be a part of her game.
Clarendon or Derby said that if Cowley had been allowed to work out his purpose
of mediation, probably all would have been settled, and that the proposition of
Russia for a Congress had been mischievous, and only involved the question in
fresh doubt and delay. But it appears evident that this was a French trick, and
that Russia proposed the Congress at the instigation of France, who sought it
for the purpose of delay, and most likely in order to extract from it a
plausible cause of quarrel. Derby in his speech attributed a great deal to the
menacing and disturbing speech of the King of Sardinia in opening his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> Chambers,
but nobody said a word of Napoleon's sortie to the Austrian Minister on the 1st
January, nor was any allusion made to various important facts which were well
known to many people in both Houses. No reproaches were cast upon Sardinia, but
a good many upon Austria; no comment made upon the flagrant breach by Sardinia
of the treaties existing between her and Austria, and of the forbearance of the
latter in not making that breach a <i>casus belli</i>, as she might well have done.</p>

<p>I went to a Council on Monday for the prorogation, when I had some conversation
with Disraeli, and asked him what his real belief was as to their prospects in
the election. He said there was so much luck in these matters that it was
difficult to speak positively, but that he had endeavoured to ascertain the true
probabilities of the result, and his conclusion was that <i>if they had luck</i> they
should gain sixty votes; and what, I asked, if there was no luck on one side or
the other? Then, he said, they should gain forty. I told him the Opposition
calculators did not believe the Government would gain at all, or at most not
above eight or ten, if so many, and asked if he was confident they should gain
from twenty to thirty anyhow. He said from the day of their taking office they
had looked forward to a dissolution, that their organisation was excellent, they
had plenty of candidates and of money, and he was quite confident they should
gain that number and more; he added that there was in no part of the country the
slightest desire for Reform, and he had altered the address he had first
intended to put forth, in consequence of finding what the prevailing sentiment
was on that question. I suppose they hold this language to justify their
dissolution, for it is difficult to believe they can really expect such results,
or that their opponents, who tell such a different story, can be so completely
mistaken.</p>


<p><i>April 24th, Newmarket.</i>&mdash;Disraeli's information on Tuesday last, when I met
him at Lady Jersey's, might well have warranted me in believing that no war
would take place, but I have never been able to persuade myself that this
calamity would be averted, and it appears that my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span> apprehensions were well
founded, for now the die seems to be really cast, and at the moment when I am
writing it is probably actually declared and begun. Though Austria is perfectly
justified in declining to wait any longer while France is maturing her
preparations, and cannot justly be blamed for bringing the affair to a crisis,
she is certain to be exposed to every sort of obloquy and misrepresentations
even in this country, and of course much more in France.</p>


<p><i>April 27th.</i>&mdash;On Monday we heard that the Austrians had sent their ultimatum to
Sardinia, and there was a complete panic in the City. Yesterday we were informed
that she had given fourteen days' grace to Sardinia, and everything was up
again. But this morning we were undeceived, and found this latter report had no
foundation. Meanwhile the clamour against Austria has been senseless and
disgraceful; nothing could be more unworthy than Derby's allusion to her in his
speech at the Mansion House dinner on Monday. It was a claptrap, and meant to
obtain popularity and assist the Ministerial interest at the election. Nothing
has ever disgusted me more than to see the readiness with which everybody finds
fault with Austria, and the care with which they avoid any notice of France,
not, however, that this can or will last. What sort of relations we shall
continue to have with France I cannot imagine. We have been treated in a manner
which puts an end to the possibility of any amicable feelings between the two
countries. We can never trust the Emperor again, and must take measures for our
own security as best we may; but unhappily the Indian war has so materially
diminished our power and absorbed our resources, and France has so enormously
gained upon us in point of naval strength, that we are not in a condition to
hold the language and play the part that befit the dignity and the honour of the
country. We can revile Austria with impunity, for we know that we are in no
danger of an attack from her, but, on the contrary, that she has so much need of
our good will that she will endure our taunts and reproaches, and not quarrel
with us even in words. It was a prophetic saying of Mackintosh forty years ago
at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span> Roehampton that it remained to be proved whether the acquisition of our
Indian Empire was in reality a gain to us, and we must hope that the remark will
not be illustrated in our days by seeing England herself placed in danger by her
exertions to retain or reconquer India, whose value is so problematical and of
which nothing is certain but the immense labour and cost of her retention.</p>


<div class="sidenote">WAR IN ITALY.</div>

<p><i>May 14th.</i>&mdash;Another severe fit of the gout, principally in the right hand, has
prevented my writing a line for the last fortnight, during which war has broken
out, and the general election has been begun and ended, and, what is most
important to myself, I have resigned my office. Hitherto the war and the
election have equally disappointed the expectations they gave rise to. The
Austrians committed a blunder in plunging into the war, and have not taken the
only advantage such a measure seemed to promise, viz. that of overpowering the
Sardinians before the French could join them, and now nobody can make out what
their tactics are, or when and where the contest will begin in earnest.
Meanwhile <i>we</i> are taking an imposing attitude of armed and prepared neutrality.
Disraeli's anticipated sixty votes have dwindled down to a gain of twenty, but
Malmesbury told Cowley that they should have force sufficient to maintain their
ground, which I see their opponents do not believe.</p>


<p><i>May 17th.</i>&mdash;The elections are nearly if not quite over, and, as well as can be
collected from the conflicting calculations of the rival parties, they present a
gain of nearly thirty for the Government. With this they evidently hope and
their opponents fear they will be able to go on at least to the end of the
session, and I incline to think so likewise. Their Government is miserably weak
and incapable, their numbers respectable, but their staff deplorable. It is
expected they will propose to Lord Elgin to take Lytton's place. The general
election has been eminently satisfactory in this, that it has elicited the
completely Conservative spirit of the country. Palmerston, who predicted that
the consequence would be a large increase of Radical strength, has been
altogether mistaken. It may be added (whether this is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span> good or an evil) that
it has also manifested the indifference of the country to all parties and to all
political ties and connexions. In the last general election the cry was all for
Palmerston, in this there has been no cry for anybody, neither for Palmerston
nor Derby, and less than all for John Russell or Bright. And yet John Russell is
flattering himself he shall have an opportunity of forming a Government, and
talks of his regret at being obliged to leave out so many of his friends. It is
remarkable that the Catholics have supported the Government, and that they have
done so under orders from Rome. Archbishop Cullen is there, and has signified to
the priests the pleasure of the Pope that the Derby Government should be
supported. Clarendon told me this yesterday, and that the reason is because they
think this Government more favourably inclined to Austria than any other,
especially than either Palmerston or John Russell would be. The Papal Government
have never forgiven the Whigs for the Ecclesiastical Titles Bill, and this
accounts for the otherwise strange support given by the Catholics to those who
have always been their bitterest enemies.</p>

<p>The war still languishes, and nobody can make out what the Austrian plans are. A
great sensation has been made by the retirement of Buol and the appointment of
Rechberg. The first report was that it was a sacrifice made to appease the
resentment of Russia, but Clarendon told me yesterday he did not believe this,
but that it was rather to satisfy some of the German Powers whom Buol had deeply
offended. Nothing could have exceeded the stupid blundering and misconduct of
the Austrian Government during the last few critical weeks, and their want of
tact towards Prussia and the German Powers. The Archduke Albrecht was sent to
Germany for the purpose of stirring up the German Powers, and professedly to
procure such a demonstration as should be the means of preventing war, and then,
while the Archduke was still at Berlin, they blurted out their ultimatum (which
was a declaration of war) without letting Prussia know what they were about. The
Archduke was obliged to declare his own ignorance of the intentions of his
Govern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>ment, and Prussia consequently to announce her disapprobation of the
measure and to signify the same to France, which was just what suited the
Emperor Louis Napoleon. I hear also that his departure from Paris was
accelerated by the necessity of repairing as speedily as possible to the seat of
war, in order to quiet the dissensions and quarrels which were already raging
between the French generals. Not a very promising beginning of the campaign.
This used to be the case formerly in the great Napoleon's time wherever he was
not present. His presence silenced these quarrels, but it remains to be seen
whether this man will have equal authority over unruly subordinates, who cannot
possibly regard him with the same deference with which the old marshals looked
up to their mighty master.</p>


<div class="sidenote">RESULT OF THE ELECTIONS.</div>

<p><i>May 24th.</i>&mdash;The elections are all over, and the Opposition leaders are already
busy in devising the means of attacking the Government. On Friday Palmerston
went to Pembroke Lodge, and had a long conference with John Russell. On Sunday
there was a gathering there, attended by Granville, George Lewis, Charles Wood,
and probably others. The question immediately to be decided is whether an
Amendment shall or not be moved to the Address. A very nice point of political
strategy. The Whig leaders are impatient to drive the Government to resignation,
without, as I believe, knowing how they are to form a Government likely to be
durable and strong. As matters stand, the Government appear to be too strong to
be driven out, and not strong enough to count upon staying in. A greater fix can
hardly be seen.</p>


<p><i>May 26th.</i>&mdash;Palmerston and John Russell have now made up all their differences,
and have come to a complete understanding and agreement on all points, so that
the schism may be considered at an end. Upon Reform, upon foreign policy, upon
the mode of opposition, they are fully agreed, and even upon their respective
personal pretensions. Both are resolved not to quit the House of Commons, and
Lord John himself says that the question of the Primacy must be determined by
the Queen herself, and that whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>ever she may send for and charge with the
formation of a Government must necessarily be Premier. There is not much doubt
that this will be Palmerston, but what post Lord John would require for himself
I have not heard. It may possibly be the Foreign Office, which Palmerston could
hardly refuse to him, particularly as they are agreed on foreign policy, and
Clarendon is not inclined to share their opinion. This reconciliation will be
very favourable to Granville's pretensions, and secure to him the lead of the
House of Lords, and not improbably, at some not very distant day, lead to his
being Prime Minister. In this age of political Methuselahs it is an enormous
advantage to be little more than forty years old. This state of affairs I heard
at Brooks's from the Duke of Bedford. It was Lord John who took the initiative
in their approaches to each other. He wrote to Palmerston, on which Palmerston
repaired to Pembroke Lodge, where they had a long conversation, with the result
aforesaid. Soon afterwards I met Disraeli in the street. He did not appear to me
to be in very high spirits, and talked of the position and chances of his
Government without any expressions of confidence, though without despondence. He
said he hoped that they would move an Amendment to the Address, as it was better
to fight it out at once and bring the question of strength to a crisis.</p>


<div class="sidenote">LORD PALMERSTON AND LORD JOHN RUSSELL.</div>

<p><i>May 29th.</i>&mdash;It seems not unlikely that the Government may be after all relieved
from the immediate danger of an Amendment by the divisions amongst the
Opposition, or rather between the rival leaders. After all I was told of the
meeting between Palmerston and Lord John, and the agreement they had come to on
all the important points, I was astonished at hearing on Friday evening that
everything was again thrown into uncertainty because Lord John would not say
what he intended to do. On the important question of who should be Premier he
would make no frank statement. He had, indeed, before said that the Queen must
decide it, and the man she sent for would naturally be at the head of the
Government; but he refused to say whether, supposing Palmerston to be sent for,
he would take office with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> and under him, or even whether he would sit in the
House of Commons on or behind the Treasury Bench&mdash;in short he would give no
clear and positive assurance of his intentions. This is naturally very
disgusting to the Whigs, and throws everything into doubt and confusion. The
Duke of Bedford is to go down to him and tell him the plain truth, which no one
else would venture to do, pointing out to him the effect of his conduct on the
sentiments of the Liberal party and on his own position, with regard to which
his conduct is indefensible and suicidal. It remains to be seen whether any
effect will be produced on his mind, but in any case nothing can look more
hopeless than it does, or promise worse for the future. Even though Lord John
should consent to act under Palmerston (and nobody expects that it is Lord John
for whom the Queen would send), there seems little hope of any cordial or
lasting union between them, or of his being satisfied with any position in which
he might consent to place himself, for his mind is evidently in a sour and
jaundiced state. The majority of the Whig and Liberal party who are come up full
of resentment from the elections are certainly desirous of attacking the
Government, but there is a considerable number of them who are averse to joining
in any vote of want of confidence, or any other move which may turn the
Government out without first being assured that another Government can be
formed, and that the union is sufficiently complete to promise that such new
Government would be strong enough to maintain itself when formed.</p>


<p><i>June 6th.</i>&mdash;As I was at Epsom every day this week, I have heard nothing of what
has been going on, except the fact that there is to be a great meeting of the
Liberals at Willis's Rooms this afternoon, called by a list of people which
includes Palmerston and Lord John and Milner Gibson, whose signature betokens
the assent of the Radicals to the object of it, which I conclude to be an
agreement as to the attack to be made on the Government to-morrow, and certain
explanations as to the intentions and sentiments of the Whig leaders. I see that
there are many dissentients from the course that is going to be adopted, many
who think this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span> attempt to oust the Government at once neither patriotic nor
politic. Without any very decided opinion, or the means of forming one, I am
rather inclined to think that it would be better to leave them alone, and to
trust to their furnishing good cause for turning them out, as they probably will
do. The Government does not appear to be obnoxious to any serious reproach and
objection, except about their mismanagement of foreign affairs. But it is very
questionable whether another Government might not give us a policy equally or
still more mischievous.</p>


<p><i>June 7th.</i>&mdash;The meeting of the Opposition yesterday at Willis's Rooms went off
as well as they could expect or desire. The two leaders gave the required
assurances that each would serve under the other, in the event of either being
sent for. There was a general concurrence in the plan of attacking the
Government at once, in which even Bright and Ellice joined, the former
disclaiming any desire for office in his own person, but claiming it for his
friends. The result promised is that with very few exceptions all the opponents
or quasi-opponents of the Government will unite in supporting the vote of want
of confidence, and they are very confident of success. On the other hand, the
Derbyites do not despair of having a majority, and they comfort themselves with
the certainty that the division must be so close, that the successful Whigs will
be able to form no Government which will have a certain working majority, and,
not impossibly, that the majority itself may be turned into a minority by the
events of the re-elections. This is not very probable, and it is rather more
likely that if Palmerston forms a Government, he will have the support of a good
many of those who will vote with the Government, as long as they remain in.
There were, however, some rather ominous manifestations made at this meeting. It
seemed to be agreed that the new Government should embrace not only Whigs and
Peelites, but 'advanced Liberals,' <i>i.e.</i> the followers of Bright, and this,
besides introducing the seeds of disunion, will probably frighten away the
Liberal Conservatives, who would like to support Palmerston, inasmuch as a
Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span> so formed would afford little security for the maintenance of
Conservative measures. Then Palmerston in no ambiguous terms announced his
pro-Gallican sympathies, and the neutrality he declared for in every possible
case which he could contemplate, together with his desire for a cordial union
with France, can mean nothing but that under his rule England should look
quietly on while France crushes Austria, and accomplishes all her ambitious and
revolutionary objects. That this policy will be hateful to many who will be his
colleagues cannot be doubted, but what is doubtful is whether those who will
object to it will have virtue and firmness enough to decline office rather than
be parties to such a policy.</p>


<p><i>June 9th.</i>&mdash;There is great excitement about this debate and the probable
division, and equal confidence on both sides of a majority. The Opposition is
the favourite, but their friends will not lay any odds. Everybody says it must
be very close, and on either side the majority will not exceed ten. On the first
night Disraeli made a capital speech, and nobody else on their side would speak
at all. This was a sort of man&oelig;uvre and attempt to bring about a division
that night, for they found out that seventeen of the Opposition had not taken
their seats, which would have secured a majority to the Government. The Whigs
therefore refused to divide, and put up one man after another to keep the debate
open, and eventually obtained an adjournment. Palmerston's speech was in
accordance with his declaration at Willis's, and with his ancient practice; it
was violently pro-French and anti-Austrian, and it was full of gross falsehoods
and misrepresentations, which he well knew to be such. In his seventy-fifth
year, and playing the last act of his political life, he is just what he always
was.</p>


<div class="sidenote">RESIGNATION OF LORD DERBY.</div>

<p><i>June 12th.</i>&mdash;After a not very remarkable debate, the division yesterday morning
gave a majority of thirteen to the Opposition, which was more than either side
expected.<a name="FNanchor_1_42" id="FNanchor_1_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_42" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Derby resigned at eleven o'clock, and the Queen immediately after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
marked her sense of his conduct by sending him an extra Garter in an autograph
letter. Much to his own surprise she sent for Granville (and for nobody else)
and charged him with the formation of a Government. What passed between Her
Majesty and him I know not, but he accepted the commission and has been busy
about it ever since. How he is to deal with Palmerston and Lord John, and to
make such a project palatable to them I cannot imagine. What the Queen has done
is a very significant notice to them of her great reluctance to have either of
them at the head of affairs, and it cannot but be very mortifying to them to be
invited to accept office under a man they have raised from the ranks, and who is
young enough to be son to either, and almost to be grandson of the elder of the
two. Nor will the mortification be less, after they have both so publicly avowed
their expectations that one or other of them must be sent for, and their having,
in what they consider a spirit of self-sacrifice, consented to serve under each
other, but without ever saying or dreaming that it could be necessary to say
they would take office under any third party. Nobody, indeed, has ever thought
of the possibility of any but one of them being called upon by Her Majesty, and
the only question has been which it would be.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_42" id="Footnote_1_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_42"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [The Amendment to the Address, implying a want of confidence in

<div class="sidenote">LORD PALMERSTON'S SECOND ADMINISTRATION.</div>

<p><i>June 13th.</i>&mdash;Lord Granville told me yesterday evening what had passed, and that
his mission was at an end, and Palmerston engaged in forming a Government. The
account of it all appears in the 'Times' this morning quite correctly. Granville
was rather disappointed, but took it gaily enough, and I think he must have been
aware from the first of the extreme difficulty of his forming a Government which
was to include these two old rival statesmen. Palmerston had the wisdom to
accede at once to Granville's proposal, probably foreseeing that nothing would
come of Granville's attempt, and that he would have all the credit of his
complaisance and obtain the prize after all. The transaction has been a very
advantageous one for Granville, and will inevitably lead sooner or later to his
gaining the eminence which he has only just missed now, which would have been
full of difficulties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> and future embarrassments at the present time, but will be
comparatively easy hereafter. Lord John's conduct will not serve to ingratiate
him with the Queen, nor increase his popularity with the country.<a name="FNanchor_1_43" id="FNanchor_1_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_43" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_43" id="Footnote_1_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_43"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [It was the refusal of Lord John Russell to serve under Lord
Granville which rendered the formation of a Cabinet by that statesman
impossible. At the same time Lord John Russell expressed his willingness to
serve under Lord Palmerston on condition of his taking the department of Foreign
Affairs.]</p></div>


<p><i>June 26th.</i>&mdash;All the time that the formation of the new Government was going on
I was at a cottage near Windsor for the Ascot races, and consequently I heard
nothing of the secret proceedings connected with the selection of those who come
in, and the exclusion of those who belonged to Palmerston's last Government, nor
have I as yet heard what passed on the subject.<a name="FNanchor_1_44" id="FNanchor_1_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_44" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The most remarkable of the
exclusions is Clarendon's, who I was sure, when the Foreign Office was seized by
John Russell, would take nothing else; and of the admissions, Gladstone's, who
has never shown any good will towards Palmerston, and voted with Derby in the
last division. This Government in its composition is curiously, and may prove
fatally, like that which Aberdeen formed in 1852, of a very Peelite complexion,
and only with a larger proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span> of Radicals, though not enough, it is said,
to satisfy their organs, and Bright is displeased that he has not been more
consulted, and probably at office not having been more pressed upon him. It is
still very doubtful whether Cobden will accept the place offered to him.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_44" id="Footnote_1_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_44"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [Lord Palmerston's second Administration consisted of the following
members:&mdash;</p></div>

<p>The Tories are full of rancour, and express great confidence that this
Government will not last, and that they shall all be recalled to power before
the end of the year. Derby had a large gathering at Salisbury's house, when he
made them a speech recommending union and moderation, the first of which
recommendations they seem more likely to adopt than the second. The affair of
his Garter was in this wise. On resigning he wrote to the Queen and besought her
to bestow Red Ribands on Malmesbury and Pakington. She wrote him an answer
acceding to his request, and adding that she could not allow him to retire a
second time from her service without conferring upon him a mark of her sense of
his services, and she therefore desired him to accept the Garter, though none
was vacant. He told me this, and said it was the only way in which he could have
taken it, as he never should have given it to himself, and I believe if a
vacancy had occurred he meant to have given it to the Duke of Hamilton.</p>

<p>While we have been settling our Government for good or for evil, the war has
continued to pursue its course of uninterrupted success of the Allies, and
unless something almost miraculous should occur, the Austrian dominion in Italy
may be considered as at an end. The sentiments of people here are of a very
mixed and almost contradictory character, for they are on the whole
anti-Austrian, anti-French, and though more indulgent than they deserve to the
Sardinians, not favourable to them. The most earnest and general desire is that
we should keep out of the <i>mï¿½lï¿½e</i>, and any termination of the war would be
hailed with gladness, because we should thereby be relieved from our
apprehensions of being involved in it. We should not be sorry to see the
Austrians driven out of Italy for good and all, though most people would regret
that the Emperor Louis Napoleon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span> should be triumphant, and that such a course of
perfidy, falsehood, and selfish ambition should be crowned with success. The
Austrians deserve their fate, for nothing can exceed the folly of their conduct,
first in rushing into the war, and thereby playing the whole game of their
adversaries, and secondly in placing in command men evidently incapable, and who
have committed nothing but blunders since the first day of the campaign.</p>

<p>This Administration lasted until the death of Lord Palmerston on October 18,
1865.]</p>


<p><i>June 27th.</i>&mdash;Yesterday I went to Kent House, where I found Clarendon and his
sister alone, and we had a long talk, in the course of which he told me all that
had passed (especially with regard to himself) about the formation of the
Government. Although he spoke very good-naturedly about Granville and his
abortive attempt, I saw clearly that he thought Granville had been in the wrong
to undertake it, and that he ought at once to have told the Queen it was
impossible, and have declined it. Though Palmerston had given a qualified
consent to act with him, it was with evident reluctance, and he had guarded it
by saying it must be subject to his approbation of the way in which the
Government was composed. Lord John's consent was still more qualified, and he
annexed to it a condition which at once put an end to the attempt. This was, as
I had suspected, that he should be leader of the House of Commons. To this
Palmerston refused to agree, and so the whole thing fell to the ground.
Granville, by Clarendon's advice, at once reported his failure to the Queen,
gave her no advice as to whom she should send for, and of her own accord she
sent for Palmerston.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD JOHN RUSSELL FOREIGN MINISTER.</div>

<p>Previously to this, and I think before the vote, Palmerston and Clarendon had
discussed the probability of Palmerston's forming a Government, when Palmerston
told him he should expect him to return to the Foreign Office. As soon as
Palmerston had been with Her Majesty, he went off to Pembroke Lodge, and saw
Lord John; told him all that had happened, and that he would of course take any
office he pleased. Lord John said, 'I take the Foreign Office.' Palmerston said
he had contemplated putting Clarendon there again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span> enumerating his reasons and
Clarendon's claims, but that if he insisted on the Foreign Office as a right, he
must have it. Lord John said, 'I do insist on it,' and so it was settled.</p>

<p>I ought to have inserted that when Palmerston and Clarendon talked the matter
over at first, Clarendon begged him not to think of him, and that if, as was
probable, John Russell desired the Foreign Office, he <i>must</i> give it him, for if
he did not, or even made any difficulty, an immediate breach would be the
consequence, and John Russell would get up a case against Palmerston which would
be very embarrassing. Palmerston at first said he should certainly insist on
Clarendon's not being put aside to please Lord John, but in the end Clarendon
persuaded him not to adhere to that resolution. After all was settled there was
a small gathering at Cambridge House, when Palmerston told Clarendon that he
might have the choice of any other office, but Clarendon replied that he was not
conversant with Colonial, Indian, or War affairs, and he would not take an
office for which there would be many candidates, while he much preferred being
out, and Palmerston would not have half offices enough to satisfy the demands
for them. Palmerston said he would not take this as his last word, and the next
day the Queen sent for Clarendon, by Palmerston's own desire, to try and
persuade him to take office. He went to Buckingham Palace and had an audience,
or rather interview, of three hours with Her Majesty and the Prince, in which
she treated him with the most touching kindness and confidence, and exhausted
all her powers of persuasion to induce him to join the Government, but he was
firm and would not. She then said, in the event of a vacancy of the Foreign
Office, 'You must promise me you will take it,' to which he replied, 'Your
Majesty knows I would do anything in the world for your service; but you must
allow me, in any case which may occur, to exercise my own discretion under the
circumstances, and to rest assured that I shall in every case be actuated solely
by a desire to do what is best for your Majesty, and most conducive to your
pleasure and interest.' The Queen talked to Clarendon of the publication in the
'Times' with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> much indignation, and said, 'Whom am I to trust? These were my own
very words.' Clarendon, however, endeavoured to convince her that the article
had in fact (however indecorous it might appear) been eminently serviceable to
her, inasmuch as it negatived any suspicion of intrigue or underhand dealing in
any quarter, and represented her own conduct in a manner to excite universal
approbation. He dilated on this in a way which made great impression both on the
Prince and on her, and ultimately satisfied her that all had been for the best,
thereby acting a very good-natured part and a very wise one.</p>


<div class="sidenote">MR. COBDEN DECLINES OFFICE.</div>

<p><i>July 4th.</i>&mdash;Cobden has declined to take office, though he was advised by his
friends to accept, and he approves of Milner Gibson and Charles Villiers having
joined the Government. The reasons he gives are that he has always been a
strenuous opponent of Palmerston, and that his conduct will be liable to
reproach in taking office under him, that he has been the advocate of economy
and low establishments, and would find himself obliged to act very
inconsistently, or to oppose his colleagues in a policy respecting which popular
opinion would be against him; but he expresses great satisfaction with
Palmerston, who he says is a much better fellow than he was aware of, and he
means to give the Government all the support in his power. These reasons do not
seem sufficient for his not joining, which he had better have done. Granville
laments Clarendon's having declined to take office as a Secretary of State, and
that he will not be in the Cabinet to throw into the scale of foreign policy his
political weight. I said I knew nothing of his motives, but assuming that he did
not see foreign affairs in the same light as Palmerston and John Russell, he
would be placed in an awkward position before long. Granville said this might be
true, but he thought before very long he would be at the Foreign Office again.
What he meant by that I do not know.</p>


<p><i>July 12th.</i>&mdash;On Friday morning the world was electrified by reading in the
'Times' that an armistice had been agreed upon between the belligerent Emperors
in Italy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> and the subsequent announcement that they were to have a personal
meeting yesterday morning, and the armistice to last for five weeks (till August
15), led to a pretty general conclusion that peace would be the result.<a name="FNanchor_1_45" id="FNanchor_1_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_45" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The
Stock Exchange take the same view, for everywhere and in all securities there
has been a great rise. I saw George Lewis on Sunday and asked him if the
Government had any intelligence, when he told me that the only thing, besides
what had appeared in the papers, was that France had proposed to us to interpose
our mediation on the basis of Austria giving up everything, and Prussia had made
the same proposal on the basis of Austria giving up nothing, both which
proposals we had very naturally declined.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_45" id="Footnote_1_45"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_45"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [The battle of Solferino was fought on June 24, and an armistice
between the Emperors of France and Austria was signed at Villafranca on July 7.]</p></div>


<div class="sidenote">THE ARMISTICE OF VILLAFRANCA.</div>

<p><i>July 13th.</i>&mdash;We had scarcely had time to begin discussing and speculating on
the probable results of the armistice, before the news of peace being actually
concluded burst upon us. As yet we have only the great fact itself and the
skeleton of the arrangement, and we shall probably be for some time without
materials for judging as to the merits of the Treaty of Peace and its probable
consequences, but the first impressions and the first ideas that present
themselves may be worth recording. There is no denying that the Emperor Napoleon
has played a magnificent part, and whatever we may think of his conduct, and the
springs of his actions, he appears before the world as a very great
character.<a name="FNanchor_1_46" id="FNanchor_1_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_46" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Though he can lay no claim to the genius and intellectual powers
of the first Napoleon, he is a wiser and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> a soberer man, with a command over
himself and a power of self-restraint, and consequently of moderation in pursuit
of objects, which the other did not possess, and therefore while the towering
genius of the uncle led him on through magnificent achievements and stupendous
vicissitudes to his ruin, it appears highly probable that the better regulated
mind and the habitual prudence of the nephew will preserve him from the
commission of similar errors, and render his career somewhat less splendid, but
more durable and infinitely more beneficial to his country.</p>

<p>With regard to the present affair, the first thing we must be struck with is the
way in which the King of Sardinia has been treated. Napoleon, indeed, tosses him
a large share of the spoils, but not only was he not admitted to the Conference
which led to peace, but he does not appear to have been consulted upon it any
more than any of the French generals; the only notice that was taken of the King
(so far as we know) being that he was ordered, upon the conclusion of the
armistice, to desist from the siege of Peschiera. I had heard before that the
Emperor was extremely disgusted with his ally and Cavour, and at all that the
latter had said and done, at the proclamations and other documents he had put
forth, and at the audacious manner in which that Government had annexed every
scrap of territory they could lay their hands on, and assumed the government of
every State that they could manage to revolutionise, and all without the
sanction and concurrence of the Emperor. Nothing is more likely than that the
Italian War will not be closed without much bickering and heartburning between
the two allies, and that the King and his Cavour will find, in spite of all they
are to obtain, that they will have no bed of roses to repose upon after their
fatigues and labours.<a name="FNanchor_2_47" id="FNanchor_2_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_47" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Then, so far as we can judge of the settlement, it seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span> one that is likely to
give more offence and disappointment than satisfaction to the bulk of the
Italian people, and to imagine that affairs will relapse or resolve themselves
into a peaceable and quiescent state is a mere delusion. What passed between the
two Emperors we may perhaps never know, though the effects of their interview
may one day become dangerously apparent; but it is not unreasonable to
conjecture that Napoleon exerted all his arts and blandishments to make a friend
of Francis Joseph, and to persuade him that a cordial alliance with France would
be more advantageous to him than one with England, and he might with every
appearance and much of the reality of truth tell him that England had done
nothing for him; that neither the Government nor the nation had any sympathies
with Austria, whom, so far from assisting, they had gladly seen defeated in
Italy; and that the forbearance of the Emperor in leaving Austria in possession
of any part of Italy would be unpalateable to Palmerston and John Russell, and
generally unpopular. One cannot but suspect that an alliance was at least
projected, if not formed, between the three great despotic Powers, France,
Austria, and Russia, for the purpose of domineering over Europe, and dealing
with the several States according to their pleasure, or the pleasure of France,
and with the ultimate object of attacking, weakening, and humbling England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CONFERENCE OF THE EMPERORS.</div>

<p>Of all the provisions of this Treaty that which regards the sovereignty of the
Pope is the most curious and seems the most difficult to carry out; it is
indicative of the necessity under which the Emperor thinks he is placed of
disarming the hostility and consulting the prejudices of the Catholic party and
the Church in France. Whether the Pope will accept the temporal office assigned
to him may be doubted, but it can hardly be doubted that his supremacy will not
be willingly accepted and acknowledged by the Italians generally, to whom the
Papal rule is already odious.<a name="FNanchor_3_48" id="FNanchor_3_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_48" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> One cannot but feel glad at the deep
mortification and disappoint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>ment which will overtake the Republicans and
Socialists, the Mazzinis, Garibaldis, Kossuths, <i>et hoc genus omne</i>, at a
pacification so ruinous to all their hopes and designs. Clarendon told me he
believed the account in the 'Times' of the compact between the Emperor and
Kossuth, and nothing is more likely than that at the beginning of the contest he
employed Kossuth in the way stated, and gave him all sorts of promises, and when
he found he could do everything <i>sine tali auxilio</i>, and that he had a stronger
interest in making friends with Austria, he threw Kossuth over without scruple
or hesitation. This is exactly the course he would be likely to follow.<a name="FNanchor_4_49" id="FNanchor_4_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_49" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_46" id="Footnote_1_46"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_46"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [The conclusion of the peace after the battle of Solferino was
creditable to the Emperor Napoleon, but was no indication of a great character.
His motives were that he had not the means of undertaking a siege of the great
fortresses of the Quadrilateral, and that if the war had been prolonged it was
not improbable that the forces of the Germanic Confederation, including Prussia,
would have taken the field against France. He therefore acted wisely in
terminating the war, and if the Austrians had withdrawn within the Quadrilateral
and refused to treat, the Emperor Napoleon might have been placed in great
difficulties. As it was, he broke his engagement to Cavour to liberate Italy
from the Alps to the sea, and to Kossuth to support a Hungarian insurrection.
Italy eventually owed the liberation of Venice, not to France, but to Prussia,
as the reward for her combined action with that Power in the war of 1866.
Cf. the account of the manner in which the peace was concluded in Lord
Malmesbury's 'Autobiography,' vol. ii p. 200.]</p>

have been published by Kossuth himself in his memoirs.]</p></div>


<p><i>July 15th.</i>&mdash;The news of the peace took everybody so much by surprise, that
people had no time to arrange their thoughts upon it; but in the midst of the
general satisfaction that the war is over, it is already apparent that there is
an explosion of disappointment and resentment to come. All the Italian
sympathisers here are in despair, Palmerston is much dissatisfied, and the
anti-Austrian Press is indignant. The King of Sardinia has not openly testified
any ill-humour, and has published an Address to his new Lombard subjects in a
joyful style, but it is impossible he should not deeply feel and resent the
contemptuous way in which he has been treated by his Imperial ally, and the
resignation of Cavour is a clear manifestation of <i>his</i> feelings on the subject.</p>

<p>When it was announced that an interview was to take place between the two
Emperors, everybody predicted that the elder of the two would have as much
success in diplomacy over his rival as he had already obtained in arms, but the
result does not appear to bear out that expectation, though we do not yet know
what the real motives of the Emperor Napoleon were in concluding such an
extraordinary peace. Granville told me that at this interview the Austrian
Emperor had taken a very high line, and shown little disposition to concession.
He said to Napoleon, 'You have conquered Lombardy, and I do not contemplate
making any attempt to recover it. I am therefore quite ready to cede it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> to
<i>you</i>, and <i>you</i> will deal with it as you please. I have nothing to say to the
King of Sardinia, and make no concessions to him. With regard to Venetia, and
the country of which I remain in possession, I have nothing to concede or to
offer, <i>all that</i> I mean to retain, but I have no objection to my Venetian
dominions forming part of the Italian Confederation.' They appear to have had a
vast deal of conversation and discussion, for they are said to have been
together for above twelve hours. What they talked about it would be interesting
to know, but which they will neither of them tell us. The field for speculation
is as wide as can well be. How the settlement of Italy is to be accomplished,
how the Italians are to be contented, and how peace in that country is to be
permanently secured, are questions enough to puzzle the acutest politicians.</p>

<p>We congratulate ourselves at having kept entirely clear both of the war and the
peace, but no doubt Palmerston is mortified, and I think England generally will
be provoked that changes of such importance should have been made without any
consultation or even communication with us.</p>

<p>The friends of the Emperor Napoleon say that they believe his motive for making
peace on any terms he could get to have been principally that he was so shocked
and disgusted at the fearful scenes of pain and misery that he had to behold
after the battle of Solferino in addition to the other battle-fields, and at the
spectacle of thousands of killed and wounded presented to his eyes, that his
nerves could not bear it. Lady Cowley told me that he was so tenderhearted that
he could not bear the sight of pain, much less being the cause of inflicting it,
and she had seen him quite upset after visiting hospitals at the sufferings he
had witnessed there, which of course are not to be compared with the horrible
scene of a battle-field. It is impossible to say that this may not be true
wholly or in part, it is impossible to account for human idiosyncrasies; but it
is quite certain that the man who is said to shrink with horror from the sight
of suffering does not scruple to inflict it in quite as bad a form when he does
not himself witness the inflic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>tion. He has hundreds and thousands of people
torn from their families, and without form of trial or the commission of any
crime sends them to linger or perish in pestilential climates, when he fancies
it his interest to do so, and for <i>their</i> sufferings he evinces no pity or any
nervous sensations.</p>


<p><i>August 7th.</i>&mdash;I have found it impossible to collect anything to record in this
book for the last month almost. The session is drawing to a close, having glided
on without difficulty for the Government, and almost without opposition. The
Election Committees have made great havoc in Palmerston's small majority, having
unseated no less than seven Liberal members. I am told, perhaps on no good
authority, that Palmerston, John Russell, and Gladstone are anxious to join in a
Congress to mix themselves up in the settlement of Italian affairs, but that
they cannot have their way, the majority of the Cabinet being opposed to it, and
the House of Commons and the country (as represented by the Press) being
decidedly against any such interference.<a name="FNanchor_1_50" id="FNanchor_1_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_50" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_50" id="Footnote_1_50"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_50"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [I think it was at this time that Lord Palmerston and Lord John
Russell proposed to the Cabinet that England should enter into a Treaty of
Alliance with France and Sardinia, but the proposal was negatived by their
colleagues. The feelings of these Ministers, however, speedily changed when the
cession of Savoy and Nice, and the manner in which it was brought about, were
known, and their language became so hostile that it gave great offence to the
Emperor Napoleon. See Lord Malmesbury, 'Autobiography,' vol. ii. p. 225.]</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">THE ITALIAN CAMPAIGN.</div>

<p>I met Edward Mildmay the other day, who gave me some account of his own personal
experiences during the last Italian campaign, when he was attached to the
Austrian Army. He confirmed all previous accounts of the excellence of that army
and the incompetency of its chiefs; that nothing could have saved the French
Army at Magenta if the Austrians had been tolerably commanded; that Giulai, who
had never seen any service, had been allowed to retain the command by the
influence of General Grï¿½nne, whose friend he is, and that the indignation and
disgust of the army at having been thus sacrificed to Court favour and
partiality had been extreme. He told me that at Solferino the Austrian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> loss was
(within a fraction of) 20,000, the French 19,000, and the Sardinians 9,000 men;
Benedek is the ablest of the Austrian generals, and if he had had the command
probably affairs would have taken a very different turn. Mildmay has no doubt
that peace was much more necessary to the French than to the Austrians, and he
still believes that if the war had continued the tide of victory would have been
rolled back, as the latter had 90,000 fresh troops coming into line. It is
probably better as it is than if the Austrians had recovered all their losses;
the Emperor Napoleon seems likely to be satisfied with his military exploits,
and to be really intending to revert to his peaceful policy. He is certainly
doing all he can to persuade the world that such is his intention, and there
seems a disposition here to take him at his word.</p>


<p><i>Viceregal Lodge, Ph&oelig;nix Park, August 22nd.</i>&mdash;I have at last accomplished the
object I have desired for so many years, and find myself in Ireland. I have
seized the first opportunity of being my own master to come here. I left London
the week before last, and went to Nun Appleton, thence to Grimstone, and on
Saturday I came here, railing through York and Manchester to Holyhead; crossed
over on a beautiful evening, with sea as smooth as glass, but it was too dark to
see the Bay of Dublin. Most hospitably received by Lord Carlisle, and very
comfortably lodged. Passed the day in Dublin yesterday; twice at church, in the
morning at Christ Church, afternoon St. Patrick's, attracted by the celebrity of
the choir and the performance of the cathedral service, which was finely done,
though the best voices (three brothers Robinson) were absent. I am greatly
struck by the fineness of the town of Dublin, and of the public buildings
especially.</p>


<div class="sidenote">EDUCATION IN IRELAND.</div>

<p><i>Dublin, August 23rd.</i>&mdash;On Monday morning the Lord-Lieutenant went to pay his
first visit since his return to the National School and took me with him. I was
much gratified at the sight, and with the appearance of the children and their
intelligence. There was a grand gathering of Commissioners and others to meet
Carlisle, but no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> Catholics except Lord Bellew and Dean&mdash;&mdash;, who alone of all
the Catholic ecclesiastics has had courage and resolution to adhere to the
system. Not one Catholic Bishop now remains on the board. Bishop Denver was the
last to resign, which it is believed he did reluctantly, but it seems that the
rule of their Synod is, that when a majority has decided, those who are in the
minority give in their adhesions, and produce unanimity. The National System is
apparently in the crisis of its fate, and a desperate struggle is being made by
the Popish clergy to destroy it, while the ultra-Protestants will join them (for
different reasons and with different objects) for the same end. I earnestly hope
these factions will fail. The most encouraging circumstance is found in the
return which was given me of the 'Central Model Schools,' in which the number of
pupils seeking admission is 1,179, an evident proof of the popularity of the
system, and that up to this time the priests have not been able to deter their
flocks from giving their children its benefits. This return is sufficiently
interesting to be copied into this journal:&mdash;</p>

<p>Carlisle was received with great enthusiasm by both pupils and teachers. After
this we went to the Hill of Killinie, whence there is a grand panoramic view of
the Bay of Dublin and the surrounding country, and then to my old friend Lady
Campbell<a name="FNanchor_1_51" id="FNanchor_1_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_51" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> (Pamela Fitz-Gerald), whose beautiful daughters are as well worth

<p><i>Dublin, August 24th.</i>&mdash;Yesterday in the morning a review in the Ph&oelig;nix Park,
after which Bagot took me to Howth Castle, which I was curious to see, but it is
not very remarkable, though very ancient. It has a modernised appearance, and is
a comfortable house, said to be the oldest <i>inhabited</i> house in Ireland, and one
of the towers of fabulous antiquity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>I remarked that the hall door was left
open, according to the traditional obligation. One of the Ladies St. Lawrence
told me the story as follows: An old woman, 'the Granawhile,' came to the castle
and asked for hospitality or alms, and was refused and driven away. She was the
wife of a pirate. On the seaside she found the young heir with his nurse, whom
she seized and carried off. Afterwards she brought the boy back, and consented
to restore him on condition that henceforward no beggar should be refused
admittance, that the hall door should be kept continually open, and that at
dinner a place should be kept and a plate laid for any stranger who might
appear. The beggars are kept away by not being admitted through the lodge gates;
the hall door is open, but there is another door behind it, and the vacant place
has by degrees fallen into disuse. I know not how old the story is, but there is
enough to show that it had a foundation of some sort, and that it retains a
relic in the customs of the family. On returning to Dublin I went to see Trinity
College, and the beautiful museum erected a few years ago. Dublin is, for its
size, a finer town than London, and I think they beat us hollow in their public
buildings. We have no such squares as Merrion Square, nor such a street as
Sackville Street.</p>


<div class="sidenote">VISIT TO IRELAND.</div>

<p><i>Bessborough, August 26th.</i>&mdash;I came here on Wednesday viï¿½ Kilkenny. A very nice
place, comfortable, and in as good order as any place in England. People
apparently well off, and cottages clean and not uncomfortable.</p>


<p><i>August 28th.</i>&mdash;Went yesterday to Waterford; pretty good town, but looking very
foreign. They showed me a hill, to which it is said Cromwell advanced, but found
the town too strong to be attacked; hence Waterford has been called the <i>Urbs
invicta</i>. I doubt the story, for he would have stormed Waterford easily enough
if he had chosen. Saw the National School; a very good establishment, boys
absent on holidays, but a very civil intelligent master, a Roman Catholic. The
clergy of neither persuasion will come near the school, except the Dean of
Waterford, who still supports it. Went on to Curraghmore, a vast and magnificent
park, but a mean house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>


<p><i>August 31st.</i>&mdash;Went on Tuesday to Woodstock; very pretty place, and in
admirable trim. Weather changing, and I fear I shall see Killarney in rain and
cold.</p>


<p><i>Viceregal Lodge, September 6th.</i>&mdash;Went to Muckrosson Thursday last; passed
three days there in exquisite enjoyment of the beautiful scenery of Killarney;
weather was perfect, and I went over and round all the lakes; returned here on
Monday, and went yesterday to the Curragh.</p>


<p><i>Jervaulx Abbey, Sunday, September 11th.</i>&mdash;Crossed over from Kingstown to
Holyhead on Thursday last; beautiful passage. Passed the last day, Wednesday, in
Dublin with William Fitzgerald seeing the town. He took me over the old Leinster
House, now the Royal Institution, and then to the Bank to see the old House of
Lords; a fine room, exactly as it was, and what was the House of Commons, now
completely altered and not retaining a vestige of the famous locality where
Flood and Grattan and Plunket once shook the walls with their eloquence. I left
Ireland with regret, for I spent several very happy days there, interested and
amused even more than I expected, and treated with great kindness and
hospitality. Went from Holyhead to Manchester, and on to Worsley to sleep; came
here on Friday. The old Abbey is very picturesque, and very perfect as a ruin.
It reminds me, place and all, of Bolton Abbey.</p>


<p><i>London, September 26th.</i>&mdash;I stayed three days at Jervaulx, then to Doncaster,
Bretby, and to town. All the Ministers in London, having passed their lives
during the last fortnight in the railway or in Cabinets, which have been very
numerous, as well they may, for they have plenty to occupy them in the Italian,
Chinese, and American questions, all, in their several ways and degrees,
extremely embarrassing. I have not the slightest conception what our Government
are doing about the Italian question, but I suppose trying to keep well with
Napoleon III., and to obtain good terms for the Italian Duchies. At present it
looks as if a Congress would be got together to untie this complicated knot, but
I fear we are not likely to play in it a part which will be consistent with our
principles, or creditable to our national character, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> wish we could
abstain from having anything to do with it. The incident about the American
Boundary is awkward, but I feel confident it will be amicably settled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISPUTES WITH CHINA.</div>

<p>The Chinese affair is the most serious, and one can see no solution of it that
is not full of objections and embarrassments.<a name="FNanchor_1_52" id="FNanchor_1_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_52" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> In the first place it looks at
present very much as if our case was a bad one. We had no business to go with an
armament and force our way up the river, and even if we were upon any ground
justified in such an extreme measure, it was to the last degree impolitic and
unwise to exercise such a right. The object for which Bruce was sent to China
was to conclude a peace, and to establish amicable relations with the Chinese
Government, and it might have occurred to him that the employment of force, even
if it was ever so successful, must infallibly defeat his object. It required no
great sagacity to perceive that the arrival at Pekin of a victorious Ambassador,
who had forced his way to the capital at the head of an imposing force, would
not serve to make his reception a friendly one, or to establish permanent
harmonious relations between the English and the Chinese Governments. As long as
there was a possibility of procuring access to Pekin by peaceful means and by
negotiation, it would have been better to be patient and to wait any time than
to employ force; and besides the political objections that seem conclusive
against the adoption of such a course, it seems highly probable that no such
force as that which we employed on this occasion could have been pushed on into
the heart of the country without imminent danger of its being cut off and
eventually destroyed. The mere fact of destroying again the Peiho forts would be
deemed by the Chinese as the renewal of the war, and the perpetrator of the
outrage would not have been received in the sacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span> character of an Ambassador,
but would have been looked on as an invader, and treated accordingly. This is
the first view of the question which presents itself. Then comes that of
vindicating our honour, and retrieving the disaster we have suffered, which
involves the necessity of rushing into war again and scattering havoc and
desolation through the country, massacring thousands of people who can make no
effectual resistance to our power, and making territorial conquests, which will
only embarrass us, and which we shall have more difficulty in getting rid of
than we shall have in making their acquisition. In short, we are going to be
engaged in a contest in which failure will be disgraceful, and success will be
inconvenient, and to place additional obstacles in the way of that good
understanding which it is so much our interest to establish with China. Nor are
our difficulties diminished by the fact of being connected with, and therefore
more or less dependent on the French, and in a less degree with the Russians and
the Americans in this unfortunate contest. This local and accidental alliance
impairs our freedom of action, and of necessity introduces delays and
complications of all sorts into the affair.</p>

'Plover' and 'Lee' gunboats grounded, and the 'Cormorant' was so damaged by the

<p><i>October 19th.</i>&mdash;Nearly a month and nothing to record, besides the events of
the day, of which I know nothing more than the newspapers report. I only take up
my pen now because Clarendon called on me, and it is worth while to recollect
the little he told me during a very short visit. I had not seen him since his
visit to Osborne in the summer, and he began by giving me an account of it. The
Queen was delighted to have him with her again and to have a good long
confidential talk with him, for it seems she finds less satisfaction in her
intercourse with either Palmerston or Lord John. The relations of these two are
now most intimate and complete, and Palmerston has obtained an entire influence
and authority over Lord John, who only sees with his eyes and without any
contest submits to be entirely guided and controlled by Palmerston. The <i>jeu</i> of
the thing is rather amusing. Palmerston, who is thoroughly versed in foreign
affairs (while Lord John knows very little about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span> them), in every important case
suggests to Lord John what to do. Lord John brings it before the Cabinet as his
own idea, and then Palmerston supports him, as if the case was new to him.</p>

<p>But to return to the Queen and Clarendon. He was unfortunately attacked by gout
and confined to his room. He was sitting there with Lady Clarendon, when Lady
Gainsborough came in and told him that she was desired by the Queen to beg he
would if possible move into the next room (the Lady-in-waiting's room) and
establish himself there; that the Queen would come in, when all the ladies
present were to go away and leave her <i>tï¿½te-ï¿½-tï¿½te</i> with him. All this was done,
and she remained there an hour and a half, talking over everything, pouring all
her confidences into his ears, and asking for his advice about everything. He
said he had endeavoured to do as much good as he could by smoothing down her
irritation about things she did not like. As an example, he mentioned that while
the Prince was with him a box was brought in with a despatch from Lord John,
which the Prince was to read. He did so with strong marks of displeasure, and
then read it to Clarendon, saying they could not approve it, and must return it
to Lord John. Clarendon begged him not to do this, that it was not the way to
deal with him, and it would be better to see what it contained that really was
good and proper, and to suggest emendations as to the rest. He persuaded the
Prince to do this, advised him what to say, and in the end Lord John adopted all
the suggestions they had made to him. On another occasion the Queen had received
a very touching letter from the Duchess of Parma imploring her protection and
good offices, which she sent to Lord John desiring he would write an answer for
her to make to it. He sent a very short, cold answer, which the Queen would not
send. She asked Clarendon to write a suitable one for her, which he did, but
insisted that she should send it to Lord John as her own. She did so, Lord John
approved, and so this matter was settled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WAR BETWEEN SPAIN AND MOROCCO.</div>

<p><i>Newmarket, October 21st.</i>&mdash;Clarendon told me, and has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span> since written to me,
that Government regard in a very serious light the approaching war between Spain
and Morocco, which they think will have the effect of putting Gibraltar in
peril;<a name="FNanchor_1_53" id="FNanchor_1_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_53" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> that Spain is playing the part of catspaw to France, who wants to get
possession of Morocco, giving Tangier to Spain, which would give her, and France
through her, the command of both sides the Straits, and as we depend upon
Tangier for supplies to Gibraltar, it would be difficult for us to hold the
place when this scheme is accomplished. He writes to-day: 'No news to-day except
that things look very fishy with Spain and Morocco, and I suspect we are going
to be vigorous, which, though it may be expedient, may also be productive of
much trouble.'</p>

<p>He was lately at Broadlands, and had much talk with Palmerston, who was very
friendly and confidential, told him everything, and appeared very anxious to
have his opinions and advice. He says that Palmerston's hatred of Austria
amounted to a monomania, and this of course produces a divergence between the
present policy of France and ours. He talked about America. When Clarendon was
lately at Clumber he discussed that affair with the Duke of Newcastle and
offered to write to Buchanan, with whom it seems he is in correspondence, and
say to him what it is desirable should be said, unofficially; and he suggested
that he should hold out to Buchanan the prospect of a visit from the Prince of
Wales, who it seems is going to Canada some time or other. This the Duke
mentioned at the Cabinet, where the proposal was highly approved, but when it
was broached to the Queen, Her Majesty objected to anything being said about the
Prince of Wales going to the United States, so it fell to the ground.<a name="FNanchor_2_54" id="FNanchor_2_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_54" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

twenty million piastres. Marshal O'Donnell, who had commanded the expedition,

<div class="sidenote">EMPEROR NAPOLEON ON ITALY.</div>

<p><i>London, October 30th.</i>&mdash;Clarendon came to town yesterday morning on his way to
Windsor and called here. He told me that we were going to send a representative
to the Congress, and I was not a little surprised to perceive that he would not
be at all disinclined to go there himself. He did not indeed say so, but unless
I am greatly deceived this is in his mind, though not without feeling the
difficulty of his acting with John Russell. Clarendon says that the preparations
going on in France are on the most enormous scale, and can have no object but
one hostile to this country, and that the feeling against England is fomented by
the Government and extending all over France. He is persuaded that the fixed
purpose of Louis Napoleon is to humble this country, and deprive her of the
great influence and authority she has hitherto exercised over the affairs of
Europe. He is bent upon getting us to take part in the Congress, and that in
order to persuade us he will pretend to be entirely agreed with us in opinion,
and only wishing to concert the most proper means of carrying out our common
objects, and when he has thus cajoled us into a participation he will throw us
over, and place us under the necessity of agreeing to what we disapprove, or of
putting ourselves <i>en dï¿½saccord</i> with all Europe. He told me that John Russell
is supposed on the Continent to be the implacable enemy of the Catholic
religion, and this will be a great disqualification for his acting at a Congress
mainly composed of Catholic Powers; that this opinion, which is rife in Ireland,
is propagated all over the world, and that the recollections of the Durham
Letter and the Ecclesiastical Titles Bill are still as strong as ever.<a name="FNanchor_1_55" id="FNanchor_1_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_55" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_55" id="Footnote_1_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_55"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [The Congress which it was proposed to hold had reference to the
affairs of Italy, which were extremely perplexing to the Emperor Napoleon
himself. But Lord Clarendon's apprehensions were certainly unfounded, for it
deserves to be remarked that about this time negotiations were opened between
the Emperor and Mr. Cobden for a commercial treaty, which was intended to
strengthen, and did strengthen, the amiable and pacific relations of France and
England.]</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>


<p><i>November 18th.</i>&mdash;- Last week at the Grove to meet the Duc d'Aumale, who is one
of the most enlightened and agreeable Princes I ever met, very simple and
natural, and full of information and knowledge of all sorts.</p>

<p>I do not remember to have gathered anything particularly interesting from
Clarendon in our various conversations, except that in the event of our
consenting to join the Congress he would not be unwilling to go to it, and that
he thinks he might be able to effect an arrangement. This confidence has in
great measure been produced by a letter from Cowley which he showed me,
containing an account of his visit to Biarritz and his communications with the
Emperor. He said he had resolved not to say a word to His Majesty of Italian
affairs, thinking the Emperor would abstain from talking of them to him, but as
soon as they met he began to talk, and went at length into the whole subject.
The upshot was that he found the Emperor in such a state of perplexity and
embarrassment, and so fully conscious of the scrape into which he had got
himself, that he did not know what to do or which way to turn; his object
evidently is to get us to help him out of his difficulty, and Clarendon thinks
that he should be able to draw him into such measures as we could support if the
matter was well managed.</p>

<p>A day or two ago the Duke of Bedford, whom I have not seen or communicated with
for a long time, called on me. He told me one curious anecdote, which he had
heard from his brother. Persigny called on Lord John one day, and told him he
was come in strict confidence to show him the letter which the Emperor had
written to the King of Sardinia, but which he must not mention even to his own
colleagues, except of course to Palmerston. Lord John promised he would not, and
a day or two after he read the letter in the 'Times.' He sent for Persigny and
asked for an explanation. Persigny said he could not explain it, but would write
to Walewski. John Russell also wrote to Cowley, who spoke to Walewski about it.
Walewski declared he could not account for it, and that it must have been sent
from Turin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> and he would write to that Court to complain of the indiscretion
and would also speak to the Emperor. He went to the Emperor, told him what had
passed, and showed him what he proposed to write to Turin, when the Emperor
said: 'No, don't write at all, take no notice of the publication. The fact is, I
sent the letter myself to the "Times" Correspondent.' It was Mocquard who took
it to him. A most extraordinary proceeding, and showing the extreme difficulty
of all diplomatic dealing between the two Governments. The Emperor is by way of
being indignant with the 'Times,' and never fails to pour forth complaints and
abuse of the paper to whomever he converses with. He did so, for instance, to
Cobden, to whom he gave an audience at Paris. But who can tell whether this is
not a pretence and a deceit, and whether he may not all the time have a secret
understanding with the 'Times'? Such a supposition would seem to be inconsistent
with their articles and his conduct, and the comments of the former upon the
latter; but how difficult it is to form any certain judgement upon a policy so
tortuous as his, and upon designs so close and councils so crooked!</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE APPROACHING SESSION.</div>

<p><i>London, December 25th</i>, 1859.&mdash;The Government are getting ready for the session
which is near at hand, Palmerston with his usual confidence, but Granville, who
is not naturally desponding, and who I dare say represents the feeling of his
colleagues, is conscious of the want of that strength and security which a
commanding majority alone can give, and, without thinking the danger great or
imminent, anticipates the possibility of their being defeated on some vital
question. The Opposition, conscious of their numerical force, but any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>thing but
united, profess the most moderate views and intentions. Derby professed at
Liverpool to have no wish to turn out the Government or to come into office
himself. Disraeli himself told me that he and all his party desired the Reform
question to be settled quietly, and that if the Government only offered them
such a Bill as they could possibly accept, they should be ready to give them
every assistance in carrying it through. Since this, Walpole has made a formal
communication to Granville (through Henry Lennox) of his and Henley's
disposition to the above mentioned end. We are told, moreover, that a great
number of the Conservative party will not only support a fair and moderate
Reform Bill, but support the Government generally, not so much, however, from
wishing well to the Government as from their antipathy to Disraeli and their
reluctance to see <i>him</i> in power again. That they will join in carrying through
a safe and moderate Reform Bill is no doubt true, but it is not probable that
the division amongst them and the hostility to Disraeli will last long, or
continue a moment after the appearance of any prospect of the return of the
Conservative party to power.</p>

<p>Disraeli raised himself immensely last year, more, perhaps, with his opponents
and the House of Commons generally than with his own party, but it is
universally acknowledged that he led the House with a tact, judgement, and
ability of which he was not before thought capable. While he has thus risen, no
rival has sprung up to dispute his pre-eminence. Walpole and Henley are null,
and it is evident that the party cannot do without Disraeli, and whenever
Parliament meets he will find means of reconciling them to a necessity of which
none of them can be unconscious, and I have no doubt that whenever any good
opportunities for showing fight may occur the whole party will be found united
under Disraeli's orders.</p>

<p>With regard to the Reform Bill, it is being proposed by a large committee of the
Cabinet, but George Lewis has the chief management of it. The state of public
opinion admits, indeed compels, the utmost moderation, but hitherto the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
anticipated difficulty has been the sort of pledge which John Russell foolishly
gave last year with reference to the franchise, to which it has been supposed he
must consider himself bound. But there is reason to believe that he is not
taking any active part in the concoction of this Bill, probably on account of
his being so absorbed in foreign affairs, and under these circumstances we may
not unreasonably expect that a fair Bill will be produced, and the question
eventually settled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A CONGRESS PROPOSED.</div>


<p>The question of still greater and more pressing interest is that of the
Congress. The nomination of Hudson met with such opposition in the Cabinet that
it was not pressed, and Lord Wodehouse was named instead. He is a clever man,
well informed, speaks French fluently, and has plenty of courage and <i>aplomb</i>;
his opinions are liberal, but not extravagant. Clarendon, who had him down at
the Grove, was pleased and satisfied with him. Granville is much <i>contrariï¿½</i>
that Clarendon himself has not been asked to go, thinking justly that he would
have much more weight than any other man, and would be far more likely to
conduct our affairs in the Congress with credit and success; but Clarendon now
tells me he certainly would not have gone if it had been proposed to him. My own
conviction <i>was</i> that he would have accepted a proposal, and though for many
reasons he would not have liked such a mission, I think he is somewhat mortified
that it was not offered to him.</p>

<p>The recent appearance of the pamphlet of 'Le Pape et le Congrï¿½s,'<a name="FNanchor_1_56" id="FNanchor_1_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_56" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which has
produced such a sensation and so much astonishment, has no doubt been a great
thing for us, and rendered our diplomatic course much more easy and promis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>ing.
Clarendon writes to me: 'This last pamphlet of the Emperor's is important and I
am sure authentic, as it is simply a developement of what I have heard twenty
times from his own lips. It ought of course to have been reserved for the
Congress, but as far as we are concerned it is well timed.' It was a bold, but a
clever stroke of policy to give notice to the whole world of the sentiments and
intentions with which the Emperor enters the Congress, and it renders a good
understanding and joint action between France and England feasible and perhaps
easy, unless Palmerston spoils everything by some obstinate and extravagant
pretensions which he may insist on his plenipotentiaries bringing forward. But
if he should be so ill advised, I believe that he would meet with an insuperable
resistance in his own Cabinet and at Court, and that Cowley certainly, perhaps
Wodehouse also, would decline being made the instruments of such a vicious and
mischievous policy.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_56" id="Footnote_1_56"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_56"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [The object of the Congress proposed by the Emperor Napoleon was to
extricate himself from the embarrassments in which he was placed by the terms of
the Peace of Villafranca with reference to the affairs of Italy. The proposal to
establish a Confederation of the Italian States was found to be impracticable,
and the unification of Italy was a more difficult problem than the conquest and
cession to Piedmont of the Milanese territory. M. de Cavour was the only
statesman who contemplated the entire realisation of this vast scheme, which was
at last accomplished by revolutionary means, without the concurrence of France.
His views were shared and supported by Lord Palmerston, Lord John Russell, and
Mr. Gladstone.]</p></div>


<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF MACAULAY.</div>

<p><i>January 2nd, 1860.</i>&mdash;The death of Macaulay is the extinction of a great light,
and although every expectation of the completion of his great work had long ago
vanished, the sudden close of his career, and the certainty that we shall have
no more of his History, or at most only the remaining portion of King William's
reign (which it is understood he had nearly prepared for publication), is a
serious disappointment to the world. His health was so broken that his death can
hardly create any surprise, but there had been no reason lately to apprehend
that the end was so near. I have mentioned the circumstance of my first meeting
him, after which we became rather intimate in a general way, and he used
frequently to invite me to those breakfasts in the Albany at which he used to
collect small miscellaneous parties, generally including some remarkable people,
and at which he loved to pour forth all those stores of his mind and
accumulations of his memory to which his humbler guests, like myself, used to
listen with delighted admiration, and enjoy as the choicest of intellectual
feasts. I don't think he was ever so entirely agreeable as at his own breakfast
table, though I shall remember as long as I live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span> the pleasant days I have spent
in his society at Bowood, Holland House, and elsewhere. Nothing was more
remarkable in Macaulay than the natural way in which he talked, never for the
sake of display or to manifest his superior powers and knowledge. On the
contrary, he was free from any assumption of superiority over others, and seemed
to be impressed with the notion that those he conversed with knew as much as
himself, and he was always quite as ready to listen as to talk. 'Don't you
remember?' he was in the habit of saying when he quoted some book or alluded to
some fact to listeners who could not remember, because in nineteen cases out of
twenty they had never known or heard of whatever it was he alluded to. I do not
believe anybody ever left his society with any feeling of mortification, except
that which an involuntary comparison between his knowledge and their own
ignorance could not fail to engender. For some years past I had seen little or
nothing of Macaulay. His own health compelled him to abstain in great measure
from going into the world. He bought a house at Campden Hill, from which he
rarely stirred, and to which he never invited me, nor did I ever call upon him
there. I have often regretted the total cessation of our intercourse, but what
else could be expected from the difference of our habits, pursuits, and
characters? I have only recently read over again the whole of his 'History of
England' with undiminished pleasure and admiration, though with a confirmed
opinion that his style is not the very best, and that he is not the writer whom
I should be most desirous to imitate; but what appears to me most admirable and
most worthy of imitation in Macaulay is the sound moral constitution of his
mind, and his fearless independence of thought, never sacrificing truth to any
prejudice, interest, or preconceived opinion whatever. Above all he was no hero
worshipper, who felt it incumbent on him to minister to vulgar prejudices or
predilections, to exalt the merits and palliate the defects of great
reputations, and to consider the commission of great crimes, or the detection of
mean and base motives, as atoned for and neutralised by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span> possession of
shining abilities and the performance of great actions. Macaulay excited much
indignation in some quarters by the severity with which he criticised the
conduct and character of the Duke of Marlborough, and the Quakers bitterly
resented his attacks upon Penn. He was seldom disposed to admit that he had been
mistaken or misinformed, and I thought he was to blame in clinging so
tenaciously to his severe estimate of Penn's conduct after the vindication of it
which was brought forward, and the production of evidence in Penn's favour,
which might have satisfied him that he had been in error, and which probably
would have done so in any case in which his judgement had been really unbiassed.
I always regretted, not for the sake of Penn's memory, but for the honour of
Macaulay himself, that he would not admit the value and force of the exculpatory
evidence, and acknowledge, as he very gracefully might, the probability at least
of his having been in error. But the case of the Duke of Marlborough is very
different, and reflects the highest honour on his literary integrity and
independence. Undazzled by the splendour of that great man's career and the halo
of admiration which had long surrounded his name, he demonstrated to the whole
world of what base clay the idol was made and how he had abused for unworthy
ends the choice gifts which Nature had bestowed upon him. Macaulay no doubt held
that in proportion to the excellence of his natural endowments was his moral
responsibility for the use or abuse of them, and he would not allow Blenheim and
Ramillies to be taken as a set-off against his hypocrisy, perfidy, and treason.
Macaulay's History is the best ethical study for forming the mind and character
of a young man, for it is replete with maxims of the highest practical value. It
holds up in every page to hatred and scorn all the vices which can stain, and to
admiration and emulation all the virtues which can adorn, a public career. It is
impossible for anyone to study that great work without sentiments of profound
admiration for the lessons it inculcates, and they who become thoroughly imbued
with its spirit, no matter whether they coincide or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span> not with his opinions, will
be strengthened in a profound veneration for truth and justice, for public and
private integrity and honour, and in a genuine patriotism and desire for the
freedom, prosperity, and glory of their country.</p>


<div class="sidenote">THE AFFAIRS OF ITALY.</div>

<p><i>January 7th.</i>&mdash;In a letter from Clarendon yesterday from the Grove he says:
'Cowley came over here last night. I had a long talk with him; he is low and
unhappy, and does not see his way out of the labyrinth; he is not for the
Congress meeting <i>now</i>, but still does not think we should abandon the Emperor
altogether in his Italian policy. The fact is, we are in a great difficulty. If
we had from the first taken the wise part of saying that as we had had nothing
to do with the war or the peace, and should therefore not interfere with the
arrangements the Emperor thought proper to make, we should now be on velvet; but
from the moment we knew of the Villafranca arrangement we have been thwarting
the Emperor, and goading him on further than he wished to go, and encouraging
the Italians to persist in their own ideas, till at last when he does what we
want, and is prepared to throw over the Pope and asks to be backed by us, it is
rather awkward to break away and declare we only wanted the credit of
recommending a fine liberal policy, but that we don't mean to be at any trouble
or expense about it.' All this is undoubtedly true, but it is the old inveterate
habit of Palmerston's policy, united with John Russell's crotchets, which has
brought it to this pass. Palmerston has always been Conservative at home and
Revolutionary abroad, and the gratification of a silly spite against Austria has
always been paramount to any other consideration and object. While the enemies
of the late Government accused them, very unjustly as the documentary evidence
has shown, of having unduly favoured Austria during the recent conflict, and
therefore having been neutral only in name, it is true that the present
Government, <i>i.e.</i> Palmerston and John Russell, have gone out of their way to
interfere in an underhand manner, and have been constantly patting on the back
the insurgent Italians, and, as Clarendon says, urging the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span> Emperor to go
further than he wishes, or than he can do consistently with the engagement he
has entered into. When Cowley was here some months ago, I remember his telling
me that one day when he met Cavour, either at Compiï¿½gne or Paris, I forget
which, when it was the question of the Congress before the war, Cavour said to
him, 'So you are going to have a Congress.' 'Yes,' said Cowley, 'thanks to you
and all you have been doing in Italy.' 'Thanks to <i>me</i>!' cried Cavour, 'I like
that; why don't you say thanks to your own Minister at Turin, to Sir James
Hudson, who has done ten times more than ever I did?'</p>


<p><i>Hatchford, January 12th.</i>&mdash;Clarendon writes to me (on the 10th): 'Cowley dined
here on Saturday and did the same at Pembroke Lodge on Sunday. He is on very
good terms with John Russell, but hardly understands what he would be at, and
for the good reason probably that Johnny does not know himself. There is a
Ministerial crisis going on at this moment about Italy, the three confederates
wanting of course to do more than the sober-minded majority can agree to. I
suppose it will be decided at the Cabinet to-day, and that some middle course
will be discovered, as I shall not believe, till it is a <i>fait accompli</i>, that
Palmerston will allow the Government to break up on a question which will not
carry the country with him. The people dislike Austria and wish well to the
Italians, but they want not to interfere in the affairs of either, and I doubt
if they would give a man or a shilling to help Palmerston in blotting Austria
out of the map of Europe and giving Sardinia a much larger slice of the map.
That twofold object amounts to monomania now with Palmerston, and I believe he
would sacrifice office to attain it, which is the highest test of his sincerity.
The three confederates are Palmerston, John Russell, and Gladstone.</p>


<p><i>London, January 22nd.</i>&mdash;For the last three weeks the sayings and doings of the
Emperor Napoleon have occupied all thoughts in every part of Europe, and he has
wellnigh recovered in this country the confidence and popularity which had been
exchanged for distrust, suspicion, and alarm. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span> would really look as if the
sole or at least the main object of his policy was to conciliate English opinion
and to ingratiate himself with the present Government; and he certainly has
exhibited great courage and above all a boundless confidence in his own power
and authority in his own country. There was a time when he paid great court to
the Catholic clergy in France, and it was supposed that his motive in retaining
the French troops in Rome (which it was known he very much disliked) was his
apprehension lest their withdrawal should expose the Pope's person or Government
to danger, which the clergy in France would not readily forgive him for doing.
When he made peace with Austria he still evinced a desire to uphold the dignity
and authority of the Pope, and therefore nobody was the least prepared for the
pamphlet of 'The Pope and the Congress.' It fell like a thunderbolt, striking
terror into the minds of all the Papal supporters and adherents, and filling
with joy all revolted Italy, and with a more sober satisfaction all the Liberals
and ultra-Protestants here.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TREATY OF COMMERCE WITH FRANCE.</div>

<p>We had hardly recovered from our amazement at this great change in the foreign
policy of France, when we were still more astonished and pleased by the
publication of the Emperor's letter to Fould, in which he announced his
intention to change the whole commercial policy of France, and to make her a
country of Free Trade. In thus confronting at once the Clerical body and the
Protectionist interest in France, he has certainly acted with enormous boldness
and reliance on his own influence and power, and it will be very interesting to
see whether the success of his policy corresponds with its audacity. The
Commercial Treaty has been in great measure the work of Cobden, who went over to
Paris under the wing of Michel Chevalier and with letters to Cowley, who
introduced him to everybody who could be of use to him in his endeavours to
forward a Free Trade policy. The scheme seems to have been arranged between the
Emperor and Fould without the knowledge or participation of any of the other
Ministers. Cobden had no mission, but he reported his progress home, and as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
acknowledgement of his exertions he is to be made joint Plenipotentiary with
Cowley in signing the Commercial Treaty.</p>

<p>The return of Cavour to power looks as if there was a secret understanding
between France and England that the King of Sardinia should be permitted to
consummate the annexation of all the revolted provinces to his dominions; for
this object, which Palmerston has so much at heart, he would gladly consent to
the transference of Savoy to France, which most people think will take place;
but everything is still and must be for some time in the greatest uncertainty in
North Italy, the only thing <i>apparently</i> certain being that the Dukes will not
recover their Duchies, and still less the Pope his Romagna.</p>


<p><i>January 24th.</i>&mdash;To-day Parliament opens, and everything promises a prosperous
session for the Government. So little spirit is there in the Opposition, that
very few of them are expected to make their appearance, and Disraeli, under the
pretext of a family affliction, gives no dinner; but the probable cause of this
is not the death of his sister, which happened two months ago, but his own
uncertainty as to whom he should invite, and who would be disposed to own
political allegiance by accepting his invitation. Such is the disorganised state
of that party.</p>

<p>Clarendon called on me yesterday, and told me various things more or less
interesting about passing events, about Cobden and the Commercial Treaty. Cobden
went over to Paris with letters from Palmerston to Cowley, begging Cowley would
give him all the aid he could in carrying out his object of persuading the
leading people there to adopt Free Trade principles, saying he went without any
mission and as 'a free lance.' Cowley did what he could for him, and he went
about his object with great zeal, meanwhile putting himself in correspondence
with Gladstone, who eagerly backed him up, but all this time nothing was said to
the Cabinet on the subject. At length one day Walewski sent for Cowley, and
asked him whether he was to understand that Cobden was an agent of the British
Government, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> authorised by it to say all he was saying in various quarters.
Cowley denied all knowledge of Cobden's proceedings, but wrote a despatch to
John Russell stating what had occurred, and at the same time a private letter,
saying he did not know whether he would wish such a despatch to be recorded, and
therefore to number it and place it in the Foreign Office, or put it in the fire
as he thought fit. John Russell accepted the despatch, and at the same time told
him he might endorse whatever Cobden did in the matter of commercial
engagements.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EMPEROR ON FREE TRADE.</div>

<p>Clarendon said that when he was at Paris four years ago for the Congress, the
Emperor one day said to him, 'I know you are a great Free Trader, and I suppose
you mean to take this opportunity of advancing Free Trade principles here as far
as you can.' Clarendon said certainly such was his intention, when the Emperor
said he was happy to be able to take the initiative with him on this subject,
and that he would tell him that it had just been settled in the Council of State
that a great change in their commercial and prohibitive system should be
proposed to the Chambers, which it was his intention to carry out as soon as
possible. But not long after the Emperor renewed the subject, and told him he
found the opposition so strong to his contemplated measures and the difficulties
so great, that he had been obliged to abandon them for the present, and as there
is no reason to doubt that the elements of opposition will be found as strong
now as they were then, it is by no means certain that His Majesty will be able
now to do all he wishes and has announced. It has already been stated in the
French papers that something is to be done to meet the objection or allay the
apprehensions of the French Protectionists, and Clarendon thinks it very
doubtful whether the Commercial Treaty, which will confer advantages on France
immediately without any reciprocal ones to us for eighteen months to come, will
be received with much favour here, especially as the loss to our revenue will
require the imposition of fresh taxes to a considerable amount.</p>

<p>We discussed the Italian question, and he said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span> Emperor is in a constant
state of doubt and perplexity, one while inclining to the Congress, and another
to leaving affairs to be settled without one. Granville told me last night there
appears a chance of the Pope's consenting to enter the Congress with the
expectation of being supported there by a majority of the Powers, and deriving
considerable benefit from such support. The Emperor Napoleon, too, now shows
some signs of drawing closer to Austria again, while Austria is quite determined
never to consent to any of the schemes of revolution and annexation which France
and England are intent upon carrying out. Apponyi told Clarendon, with tears in
his eyes, that they were ruined, and quite unable to take any active part, but
that in the way of <i>passive</i> resistance they might still do a great deal, and
that they should not only refuse with the greatest perseverance to set their
hands to any paper acknowledging the new state of things, but that they should
solemnly protest against it on every occasion and in every way in their power.
Austria therefore never will consent to the annexation of Central Italy to
Piedmont, and if it takes place in spite of her remonstrances and in direct
violation of the conditions of Villafranca and Zurich, she will not only
<i>refuse</i> her recognition, but proclaim her intention of biding her time, with a
view to avail herself of future possible contingencies to redress the wrongs of
which she may justly complain. I asked Clarendon if he did not think it possible
a <i>mezzo termine</i> might be effected by which France and Austria might again be
put <i>d'accord</i>, France saying, 'I would carry out the stipulations of Zurich if
I could, but you see it is impossible. Still I will not consent to arrangements
obnoxious to you and in direct violation of them, such as the annexations to
Piedmont; let us recur to the formation of a Central Italian independent State.'
Clarendon said this had been his own idea, and he still thought it was not
impossible that such a compromise should be effected. It is hardly possible to
doubt that if Cavour succeeds in annexing to Piedmont all the Central Italian
States, a very short time will elapse before war will break out again between
Sardinia and Austria, and that Austria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span> will have to relinquish her Venetian
possessions or fight for their retention.</p>


<p><i>January 27th.</i>&mdash;The session opened with great appearance of quiet and
prosperity for the Ministers, which nothing that passed the first night in
either House threatened to disturb. Derby made a very good and moderate speech.
When he left office the Queen entreated him not to use the power he seemed to
have from the nearly balanced state of parties to upset this Government, urging
the great objections there were to eternal changes, and she repeated the same
thing to him when he was at Windsor on a visit not long ago. Derby expressed his
entire concurrence with her, and he promised to act in conformity with her
wishes, and he has entirely done so. Nothing could be more temperate and
harmless than the few remarks he made on Tuesday night, but leaving himself
quite unfettered on every point.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OPPOSITION TO THE COMMERCIAL TREATY.</div>

<p>In the meantime there is apparently a strong feeling of doubt and
quasi-hostility getting up against the Commercial Treaty, and it looks as if the
English and French Governments would both have great difficulties in the matter.
Public opinion here remains suspended till the Treaty is produced, and till we
are informed what the immediate sacrifices may be that we shall have to make for
it, and what are the prospective advantages we obtain in return. The French
Protectionists are more impatient and have begun to pour out their complaints
and indignation without waiting to see the obnoxious Convention. Thiers is said
to be furious. So far from any Commercial Treaty like this cementing the
alliance, and rendering war between the two countries more difficult, it is much
more likely to inflame the popular antipathy in France, to make the alliance
itself odious, and render the chances of war between the two countries more
probable. In maturing his scheme Louis Napoleon has given it all the appearance
of a conspiracy, which is in accordance with his character and his tastes. The
whole thing was carried on with the most profound secrecy, and the secret was
confined to a very few people, viz. the Emperor himself, Fould, Rouher (Minister
of Com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>merce), Michel Chevalier, and Cobden. All the documents were copied by
Madame Rouher, and Rouher was so afraid that some guesses might be made if he
was known to be consulting books and returns that were preserved in the Library
of the Council of State, that he never would look at any of them, and made
Chevalier borrow all that he had occasion to refer to. Now the Emperor springs
this Treaty upon his reluctant Chambers and the indignant Protectionist
interest. His manner of doing the thing, which he thinks is the only way by
which it can be done at all, naturally adds to the resentment the measure
excites. They feel themselves in a manner taken in. The objections here are of a
different kind and on other grounds, but Gladstone kept his design nearly as
close as the Emperor did, never having imparted it to the Cabinet till the last
moment before Parliament met. I do not know how the Cabinet looked at it, only
that they were not unanimous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE REFORM BILL OF 1860.</div>

<p>While, however, it seems at least doubtful how the Government will fare when
they produce this Treaty, it appears certain that they will get into a scrape
with their Reform Bill. I had imagined from all I heard that the Government were
certain to bring forward a measure so moderate as to insure the support or at
least prevent the opposition of the Conservatives, or certainly of a large
proportion of them. Everything rendered this probable. The assurances conveyed
to the Government by Walpole, the professions of Disraeli, the apathy of the
country, and the total failure of Bright's attempts to get up the steam, all
encouraged them to take this course, and the Duke of Bedford told me Lord John
was not so tied and bound by his declarations last year that he would not concur
in any moderate measure that the Cabinet might frame. A few days ago, however, I
asked Clarendon what the Bill would be, and he alarmed me by his reply that 'it
would be as bad as possible,' John Russell having insisted upon the franchise
being in accordance with his pledges, and upon his consistency being entirely
preserved. This meant of course a 6<i>l.</i> franchise, which everybody denounces as
full of mischief and danger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>Just now Henry Lennox came to me and told me that all the dissensions and
jealousies of the Conservative party and the Carlton Club had been suddenly
appeased, and that from being split into little sections and coteries,
squabbling among themselves and forming plots to oust Disraeli, and elevate one
man or another in his place, they were suddenly reunited as one man in
opposition to the Bill that they hear is to be offered to them, and that
Disraeli will be higher than ever in their confidence and support. The
Government estimate their majority at four, leaving out of calculation the Irish
Catholics, who will probably all vote against them on every question, and the
Conservatives boast of having 320 men who will cling together with immoveable
constancy in opposition to the 6<i>l.</i> clause. That they will be able to carry it
under these circumstances seems impossible. Lord John is himself to bring on the
Reform Bill. The best thing that could happen (unless they are warned in time
and alter their measure) would be that he should be beaten on the 6<i>l.</i>
franchise, go out upon it and the rest stay in; but whether they would think
themselves bound to stand or fall with him and break up the Government for his
sake, I have at present no idea. The Queen would no doubt do all in her power to
induce Palmerston to let him go, replace him, and carry on the Government
without him. His loss would be a gain in every possible way, and the Government
would be strengthened instead of being weakened by his absence, even though he
should throw himself into the arms of Bright and join him in a Radical
opposition to his former colleagues.</p>


<p><i>Bath, February 15th.</i>&mdash;When I left London a fortnight ago the world was
anxiously expecting Gladstone's speech in which he was to put the Commercial
Treaty and the Budget before the world. His own confidence and that of most of
his colleagues in his success was unbounded, but many inveighed bitterly against
the Treaty, and looked forward with great alarm and aversion to the Budget.
Clarendon shook his head, Overstone pronounced against the Treaty, the 'Times'
thundered against it, and there is little doubt that it was unpopular, and
becoming more so every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span> day. Then came Gladstone's unlucky illness, which
compelled him to put off his <i>exposï¿½</i>, and made it doubtful whether he would not
be physically disabled from doing justice to the subject. His doctor says he
ought to have taken two months' rest instead of two days'. However, at the end
of his two days' delay he came forth, and <i>consensu omnium</i> achieved one of the
greatest triumphs that the House of Commons ever witnessed. Everybody I have
heard from admits that it was a magnificent display, not to be surpassed in
ability of execution, and that he carried the House of Commons completely with
him. I can well believe it, for when I read the report of it the next day (a
report I take to have given the speech verbatim) it carried me along with it
likewise. For the moment opposition and criticism were silenced, and nothing was
heard but the sound of praise and admiration. In a day or two, however, men
began to disengage their minds from the bewitching influence of this great
oratorical power, to examine calmly the different parts of the wonderful piece
of machinery which Gladstone had constructed, and to detect and expose the weak
points and objectionable provisions which it contained. I say <i>it</i>, for, as the
Speaker writes to me, it must be taken as a whole or rejected as a whole, and he
adds the first will be its fate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. GLADSTONE'S BUDGET.</div>

<p>Clarendon, who has all along disapproved of the Treaty, wrote to me that
Gladstone's success was complete, and public opinion in his favour. He says: 'I
expect that the London feeling will be reflected from the country, so that there
will be no danger of rejection, though I think that the more the whole thing is
considered, the less popular it will become. The no-provision for the enormous
deficit that will exist next year will strike people, as well as the fact that
the Budget is made up of expedients for the present year. The non-payment of the
Exchequer bonds is to all intents and purposes a loan; the war tax on tea and
sugar, the windfall of the Spanish payment, the making the maltsters and
hopgrowers pay in advance, &amp;c., are all stopgaps. If anybody proposes it, I
shall not be surprised if an additional 1<i>d.</i> Income Tax in place of the war
duties was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span> accepted by Gladstone. He has a fervent imagination, which furnishes
facts and arguments in support of them; he is an audacious innovator, because he
has an insatiable desire for popularity, and in his notions of government he is
a far more sincere Republican than Bright, for his ungratified personal vanity
makes him wish to subvert the institutions and the classes that stand in the way
of his ambition. The two are converging from different points to the same end,
and if Gladstone remains in office long enough and is not more opposed by his
colleagues than he has been hitherto, we shall see him propose a graduated
Income Tax.' These are only objections to the Budget, and speculations (curious
ones) as to the character and futurity of Gladstone.</p>

<p>In another letter he says: 'Gladstone made a fair defence of the Treaty, though
there are things in it which deserve the severest criticism and will get it,
such as tying ourselves down about the exportation of coal (which is a munition
of war), letting in French silks free while ours are to pay thirty per cent.,
and establishing a differential duty of nearly fifty per cent. in favour of
light French wines against the stronger wines of Spain and Portugal, for that
will be the operation of the Treaty.' Since all this was written there has been
a meeting of the Conservative party, and I hear this morning that Derby has
decided to take the field with all his forces with a Resolution against the
condition about the exportation of coal, and confining himself to that, which
will very likely be carried. On the other hand, the publicans and licensed
victuallers appear to be in arms against that part of the Budget which more
immediately interests them, and are waging a fierce war in the Press by their
paper, the 'Morning Advertiser,' so that in spite of his great triumph and all
the admiration his eloquence and skill elicited, it is not all sunshine and
plain sailing with his measures. Delane writes to me that Gladstone will find it
hard work to get his Budget through, that Peel when he brought forward his
Budget had a majority of ninety, all of which he required to do it, whereas
Palmerston cannot command a majority of nine.</p>


<p><i>London, February 22nd.</i>&mdash;I returned to town on Monday.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span> The same night a battle
took place in the House of Commons, in which Gladstone signally defeated
Disraeli, and Government got so good a majority that it looks like the harbinger
of complete success for their Treaty and their Budget. Everybody agrees that
nothing could be more brilliant and complete than Gladstone's triumph, which did
not seem to be matter of much grief to many of the Conservative party, for I
hear that however they may still act together on a great field-day, the hatred
and distrust of Disraeli is greater than ever in the Conservative ranks, and
Derby himself, when he heard how his colleague had been demolished, did not seem
to care much about it. They say that he betrays in the House of Commons a sort
of consciousness of his inferiority to Gladstone, and of fear of encountering
him in debate.</p>


<p><i>February 26th.</i>&mdash;On Friday night Gladstone had another great triumph. He made a
splendid speech, and obtained a majority of 116, which puts an end to the
contest. He is now <i>the</i> great man of the day, but these recent proceedings have
strikingly displayed the disorganised condition of the Conservative party and
their undisguised dislike of their leader. A great many of them voted with
Government on Friday night, and more expressed satisfaction at the result being
a defeat of Disraeli. The Treaty and Budget, though many parts of both are
obnoxious to criticism more or less well founded, seem on the whole not
unpopular, and since their first introduction to have undoubtedly gained in
public favour. This fact and the state of the Opposition prove the impossibility
of any change of Government. Gladstone too, as he is strong, seems disposed to
be merciful, and has expressed his intention of taking fairly into consideration
the various objections that may be brought forward, and to consent to reasonable
alterations when good cases are made out for them. There seems no doubt that his
great measures were not approved of by the majority of the Cabinet, but the
malcontents do not seem to have been disposed to fight much of a battle against
the minority, which included both Palmerston and Lord John.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>It is curious how this great question has thrown into the background all the
questions about Italy and foreign policy, in regard to which public interest
seems to be for the moment suspended, while Italian affairs are at a dead lock.
It would be very inconsistent with the Emperor's character if he had given up
his design of appropriating Savoy, but he has certainly postponed it, and will
probably employ his versatile imagination in weaving some fresh web by means of
which he may get it into his power. I have been reading the Italian Blue Book,
which is a creditable compilation. John Russell's positions are not unsound, but
he is too controversial in his tone, and though he treats Austria with a decent
consideration, and in no unfriendly spirit, he might as well have avoided
arguing with Count Rechberg upon points and principles on which it was
impossible they should ever agree. Throughout this compilation the embarrassment
and perplexity of the Emperor Napoleon are conspicuous, and the difficulties
into which he got himself by his vacillations and incompatible objects and
obligations. His desire to adhere to the engagements he contracted at
Villafranca is obvious throughout, and the advice he gave the Pope seems to have
been the best possible, and given in all sincerity.<a name="FNanchor_1_57" id="FNanchor_1_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_57" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_57" id="Footnote_1_57"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_57"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [The Emperor told Metternich the other day that he had made one
great mistake, which he had never ceased to regret, that immediately after
Villafranca he ought to have marched 100,000 men into Tuscany on the plea of
embarking them at Leghorn, and continued to occupy the country till the
restoration of the Grand Duke was accomplished, but that he had never
contemplated the invincible resistance of the whole population.&mdash;C. C. G.]</p></div>


<div class="sidenote">MR. GLADSTONE'S RADICALISM.</div>

<p><i>February 27th.</i>&mdash;Gladstone is said to have become subject to much excitement,
and more bitter in controversy in the House of Commons than was his wont. The
severe working of his brain and the wonderful success he has obtained may
account for this, and having had his own way and triumphed over all opposition
in the Cabinet, it is not strange that he should brook none anywhere else. He
has not failed to show a little of the cloven foot, and to alarm people as to
his future designs. Clarendon, who watches him, and has means of knowing his
disposition, thinks that he is moving towards a Democratic union with Bright,
the effect of which will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span> increased Income Tax and lowering the estimates by
giving up the defences of the country, to which Sidney Herbert will never
consent, and already these old friends and colleagues appear to be fast getting
into a state of antagonism. Aberdeen told Clarendon that they would never go on
together, and he thought Sidney Herbert would retire from the Cabinet before the
end of the session. This of course implies that Gladstone's policy is to be in
the ascendant, and that he is to override the Cabinet.</p>

<p>There has been a dispute about the introduction of the Reform Bill. Lord John's
colleagues wished him to defer bringing it on, till more progress had been made
in the fiscal and commercial measures, and represented the inconvenience of
having the two discussions going on at the same time, but nothing would induce
him to postpone it, and for the absurd reason that he wanted to bring in this
Bill on the <i>same day</i> on which he had introduced the great Reform Bill in 1831,
and to this fanciful object he insisted on sacrificing all others.</p>


<p><i>Hatchford, March 7th.</i>&mdash;Lord John Russell brought in his Reform Bill last week
without exciting the smallest interest, or even curiosity, amidst profound
indifference in the House and in the country. His measure was very moderate, and
his speech temperate. It produces no enthusiasm, or satisfaction, or alarm. It
will probably pass without any violent debates, and perhaps with very slight
alterations. If the opponents should succeed in making some, Lord John is not
prepared to adhere obstinately to his measure, but will come to terms. It was
settled that no discussion should take place at the time, and nobody was
inclined for any. It hardly delayed the progress of Gladstone's measures, so we
heard no more complaints of Lord John's pertinacity in bringing it on upon March
1st.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ASCENDENCY OF THE EMPEROR NAPOLEON.</div>

<p>The Treaty, the Budget, and the Reform Bill had thrown foreign affairs into the
background, but the interest in them was suddenly aroused, and speedily absorbed
every other, by the Emperor's speech and M. Thouvenel's despatches, all so
mortifying and provoking to us. Up to this moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span> Palmerston had been highly
elated, and he and Lord John had been exulting in the fancied glory of being the
Liberators of Italy, and of having procured the complete success of their own
objects. As Clarendon wrote to me, 'The Emperor must greatly enjoy the
helplessness of Europe, and in feeling that he may do just what he likes with
perfect impunity. Russia is crippled, Austria rotten, Germany disunited, and
England, though growling, occupied in gnawing the Treaty bone he has tossed to
her. All must submit to the laws made known to them through the "Moniteur."' If
it were not so melancholy to see the miserable figure which England cuts in all
this, it would be amusing to see it happen <i>regnante</i> Palmerston, and after all
his incurable meddling and blustering to see him obliged to eat so much dirt. He
may (though probably he does not) think he has lived too long to be reserved at
the last period of his political career for such mortification. The Emperor said
to somebody, 'L'Europe boudera, mais ne fera rien,' and he is quite right. We
seem to have arrived at the last act of the Italian drama, but it is still very
uncertain how the <i>dï¿½nouement</i> will be worked out and what the Emperor's final
will and pleasure will be. The Romagna seems to present the greatest difficulty;
all the rest will find a tolerably easy solution. France will take what she
wants of Savoy and give the rest to Switzerland, who upon those conditions is
desirous of annexation, and Piedmont does not seem to care much about it. In
this way the question of Savoy will be settled, if not by general consent, at
least with general acquiescence and without any opposition.</p>


<p><i>March 9th.</i>&mdash;After all it is not improbable that Palmerston will have the
gratification of seeing Tuscany annexed to Sardinia. Cavour has taken the line
which Clarendon and I agreed that he would very likely do, and sets France and
Austria at defiance. We have seen France and Sardinia joined in making war upon
Austria, and now we have France and Austria joined in diplomacy against
Sardinia. Nothing can be more curious than to see the unravelling of this web.
Next week the Italian States will severally vote their annexation to Sardinia,
or their separate existence. If, as is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span> almost certain, the former is their
decision, the King will accept their resolution, and Piedmontese troops will
march into Tuscany. Then we shall see what the Emperor Napoleon will do, and
what he will permit Austria to do.</p>


<p><i>Savernake, March 18th.</i>&mdash;The affair of Savoy has been summarily settled by the
will of the Emperor and the connivance of Cavour. The whole affair now appears
to have been a concerted villainy between these worthies, which as the plot has
been developed excites here the most intense disgust and indignation. The
feeling is the stronger because we have no choice but that of sulky and
grumbling acquiescence. The one redeeming point in the French act of violence
<i>was</i> the apparent respect paid to Treaties and to the claims of Switzerland,
Thouvenel having only the other day said that Faucigny and Chablais should be
ceded at once to Switzerland; and now we hear that nothing of the kind is to be
done, and that France seizes everything.<a name="FNanchor_1_58" id="FNanchor_1_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_58" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It is in vain that the Houses of
Parliament are advised to cease barking, as they certainly do not mean to bite,
and that the 'Times' recommends silence and moderation; such enormities as are
unblushingly exhibited to the world excite an indignation which breaks through
every restraint, and people <i>will not</i> hold their peace, happen what may. The
Opposition have turned the current of their wrath upon our Government, and have
proved clearly enough that they had ample and timely notice of the Emperor's
intentions, and that nevertheless they continued to urge with all their might
that policy which was certain to lead to the annexation of Savoy. That the
Emperor and Cavour have been plotting together seems now quite certain, but we
are still ignorant, and may perhaps ever remain so, of the details of their
delusive operations.</p>

time the desire of the Emperor to do anything he could <i>to help Lord
Palmerston</i>, and accordingly he proposed, unofficially, to surrender and annex a
considerable portion of the Faucigny district, down to the Fort de l'Ecluse, in
the Jura, to the Canton of Geneva, provided the British Government would assent
to the acquisition by France of the rest of Savoy. Lord Palmerston rejected the
proposal, saying to the person who conveyed it to him, 'We shall shame them out
of it.'&mdash;H. R.]</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">THE TREATY, THE BUDGET, AND THE BILL.</div>

<p>The three great subjects which have occupied public attention all this year have
been the Italian and its branches, Gladstone's Treaty and Budget, and the Reform
Bill. Up to the present time the two first have absorbed all interest, and the
new Reform Bill has been received with almost complete apathy, nobody appearing
to know or care what its effects would be, and most people misled by an apparent
show of moderation and harmlessness in its details. But in the course of the
last week the 'Times' set to work, in a series of very able articles, to show
the mischievous and dangerous effects that the proposed franchise will produce,
and these warnings, supported by ample statistical details, have begun to arouse
people from their indifference and to create some apprehensions. I am informed
that John Russell framed his Bill in utter ignorance of these important details,
and, with the mixture of levity and obstinacy which has always distinguished
him, has plunged the country into this dilemma for the sake of his own selfish
and ambitious objects. But what is incomprehensible is that in such a numerous
Cabinet as the present, and containing many men who certainly once had strong
Conservative opinions, he should not have met with a more strenuous opposition,
and have been forced to alter his most obnoxious propositions, and I think those
who were better informed than Lord John, and saw whither his plan of Reform was
leading them, are more to blame than himself. It is impossible to meet with any
man who approves of this Bill, and who does not abhor the idea of any Reform
whatever. All say that if the members voted by ballot there would be almost
unanimity against it, and yet such is the disorganised state of the Conservative
party, and such the want of moral courage and independence generally, that this
Bill will most likely pass unaltered.</p>

<p>The prevailing hope is that the House of Lords will amend it, but Derby told
somebody (I think it was Clarendon) that if those who dreaded the mischief of
the measure in the House of Commons had not the courage and honesty to oppose it
there and correct it, the House of Lords should not, so far as his influence
went, incur the odium of doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span> the work which, the House of Commons ought
itself to do. Lyndhurst told me the other day that Derby had told Lady Lyndhurst
he was so disgusted with the state of affairs at home and abroad, that he had
serious thoughts of withdrawing from public life, and Clarendon told me that an
eminent Conservative, who had begged not to be quoted, had said that he knew
Derby was violently discontented with Disraeli, and prepared to dissolve their
political connexion.</p>


<p><i>Wells, March 21st.</i>&mdash;I came here from Savernake on Monday. On Friday last in
the House of Lords the Commercial Treaty and Budget, but the latter especially,
were powerfully assailed by Grey, Overstone, and Derby, and very considerably
damaged <i>in argument</i>, but probably in nothing else. The Government are as weak
in the Lords as the Opposition are in the Commons, where, however, Disraeli
seems to have made a very good speech against the Reform Bill on Monday night.</p>


<div class="sidenote">LORD JOHN DENOUNCES NAPOLEON.</div>

<p><i>Torquay, March 28th.</i>&mdash;The past week has been remarkable for the speech in
which John Russell denounced in strong language the conduct of France, declared
that we could no longer trust her, and that we must renew our intimacies with
the other Powers. Whether all this was sincere and meant all it seems to do is
yet to be discovered. The week was near being still more remarkable, for the
Reform Bill was within an ace of falling to the ground by the House being
counted out in the midst of a debate. This would have been very ridiculous, but
would have been hailed with delight by the House of Commons, and without
dissatisfaction by the country. Clarendon writes to me in a strain of bitter
hostility to the Bill and disgust at everything, complains of the general apathy
and the impossibility of rousing any spirit of opposition to what all abhor.
Derby told him that if twenty-five or even twenty Liberals would <i>take the lead</i>
in opposing this Bill, the whole Conservative party would support them.
Clarendon wrote to me when I was at Bath that the time would probably come when
Gladstone would propose a graduated Income Tax, and lo! it has nearly come, for
Gladstone gave notice the other night to people to be pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>pared for it. The
Triumvirate of Palmerston, John Russell, and Gladstone, who have it all their
own way, dragging after them the Cabinet, the House of Commons, and the country,
will probably be the ruin of this country. They are playing into the Emperor
Napoleon's hands, who has only to be patient and bide his time, and he will be
able to treat all Europe, England included, in any way he pleases. Nothing but
some speedy change of Government and of system can avert the impending ruin.</p>


<p><i>London, April 2nd.</i>&mdash;One day last week (as mentioned above), on one of the
numerous discussions of the Savoy question in the House of Commons, John Russell
electrified the House and rather astonished the country by delivering a very
spirited speech, denouncing in strong terms the conduct of the Emperor Napoleon,
and declaring the necessity of cultivating relations with the other Great Powers
for the purpose of putting an effectual check upon the projects of French
aggrandisement and annexation. I must own that my first impression was that this
speech was made merely to deceive the House and the country, and was only a part
of the collusive system between our Government and the French, by virtue of
which Louis Napoleon has been enabled to work out all his objects and designs;
but though it is impossible to doubt that John Russell and Palmerston have all
along been aware of the Emperor's intentions with regard to Savoy, and that they
have been more intent upon procuring advantages for Sardinia and provoking
Austria than upon thwarting the projects of France, I am inclined to see Lord
John's speech in another light from what I hear since I came to town. He made it
without any previous consultation with his colleagues, it having been one of
those impromptus which he is so apt to indulge in, and Palmerston, seeing the
way in which it was received in the House and by the Press, approved of its tone
and expressed a full concurrence with it. Flahault, who went to Paris a few days
ago, called on Palmerston before he went and asked if he wished him to say or do
anything there. Palmerston said he might inform the Government that Lord John's
speech expressed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span> unanimous opinion of the Cabinet here. In my opinion his
speech was a great imprudence, and will probably involve the necessity of our
eating a great deal of humble pie. We have long ago declared that though we
disapprove very much of the annexation of Savoy, we should take no steps to
prevent it; but Lord John made a great distinction between the question of Savoy
and Nice and that of Faucigny and Chablais, and though he did not commit himself
to any positive course, he gave it to be inferred that something more would be
required from us, in the way of opposition to the seizure of the latter, than
there was any necessity for our making to that of the former. But the Emperor
makes no such distinctions, and if, as is most probable, he does not admit our
right to draw them, we shall be in an unpleasant fix, and have to back out of
the position we have assumed in a way neither dignified nor creditable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SCHEMES OF THE EMPEROR.</div>

<p>The accounts from Paris are that this speech has made the French very insolent,
and the Emperor more popular than he has been for a long time, as even his
enemies say that they will rally round him to chastise English impertinence.
Then as to forming alliances with the other Powers, which of course will be
taken (as was intended) as a menace to France, nothing could be more ill-advised
than such an announcement, for the other Great Powers have neither the ability
nor the inclination to join us in any coalition, present or prospective, against
France. Russia and Austria hate us, as well they may, for we have done them both
all the injury in our power, besides heaping every sort of insult upon them.
Austria is totally ruined, hopelessly bankrupt and torn to pieces with internal
disaffection and discontent. Russia is hampered with her great serf question,
and overwhelmed with financial embarrassments, which she owes in great measure
to the Crimean War, and the unfortunate dissension and estrangement between her
and Austria are attributable to the same cause and to our policy. Prussia, the
only one of the three that is able to make any efforts, and that has no cause of
enmity against us, is always selfish and timorous, and is more occupied in
trying to supplant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span> Austria in Germany than in taking defensive measures against
French ambition; nor is there in Germany any such strong sentiment of national
independence as might induce the various States to sink their minor jealousies
and partisanships in a general union, to meet any aggression that may proceed
from France. Among the many schemes which the Imperial brain is supposed to be
continually engendering, it is far from impossible that one may be the
reconstruction of the kingdom of Westphalia, or at least of some Rhenish kingdom
with the concurrence of Prussia, by concluding a bargain of partition with her.
He might then replace old Jerome on the throne, and so get rid of his obnoxious
son, of course taking as much of such acquired territory as he wanted for
himself. All this is mere vague conjectural speculation, but it is <i>on the
cards</i>, and it is at least as probable as that we should be able to form another
coalition, like that which overthrew the first Napoleon, strong enough to cope
with the present Napoleon. People are beginning at last to doubt whether the war
we waged against Russia four years ago was really a wise and politic measure;
but the whole country went mad upon that subject, I never could understand why.
Palmerston took it up to make political capital out of it, and made himself
popular by falling in with the public humour, and making the country believe
that he was the only man really determined to make war on Russia, and able to
bring the war to a successful end. Aberdeen, who was wise enough to see the
folly of quarrelling with Russia and sacrificing all our old alliances to a new
and deceitful one with France, was unable to stem the torrent, and fell under
its violence. His fault was his not resigning office when he found it impossible
to carry out his policy and maintain peace.</p>

<p><i>A propos</i> of the Russian War, I heard lately an anecdote for the first time
that surprised me. Everybody knows that we beat up for allies and even mercenary
aid against Russia in every direction, but it is not known that our Government
earnestly pressed the Portuguese Government to join in the war, and to send a
contingent to the Crimea, and that on the refusal of the latter to do so, the
Ministers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span> made the Queen appeal personally to Lavradio and urge him to persuade
his Government to comply with our wishes; but Lavradio represented to Her
Majesty, as he had done to her Ministers, that Portugal had no quarrel with
Russia, and no interest in joining in the war; on the contrary, Portugal was
under obligations to the Emperor of Russia, and she therefore would have nothing
to do with the contest. This was a most extraordinary proceeding, and it was
contrary to all usage as well as all propriety to make the Queen interpose in
person on such an occasion.</p>


<div class="sidenote">DANGER OF WAR WITH FRANCE.</div>

<p><i>April 4th.</i>&mdash;Clarendon has just been here talking over the state of affairs, in
the course of which he alluded to what had passed in the autumn of '58 between
the Emperor and him, and between His Majesty and Palmerston. In September he had
a long conversation with the Emperor, in the course of which he asked Clarendon,
'Supposing I find myself compelled to go to war with Austria, what part would
England take in the contest?' Clarendon replied that it would depend upon the
circumstances of the case and the cause that would be shown for such a war, and
that he must not be misled by the language of the English Press and the
prejudice which no doubt existed in England against Austria and her system of
government, which would not be sufficient to make us take any part against her.
On comparing notes with Palmerston afterwards, Clarendon found that Louis
Napoleon had put the same question to Palmerston, who had given him the same
answer. When they went to Compiï¿½gne in November of the same year, they both had
conversations separately of the same character, and when they afterwards
compared notes and Clarendon asked Palmerston what impression the Emperor's
words had left on his mind, Palmerston replied he thought either that the
Emperor had abandoned the design he had certainly been meditating to go to war,
or he had resolved upon it, but did not choose to acknowledge his intentions to
them, and this Clarendon said was exactly the same opinion as he had formed.
This, however, was not above six weeks before his famous speech to the Austrian
Ambassador (which was a declaration of war), and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span> therefore the latter
conjecture was the correct one. We talked over Lord John's speech and his letter
in answer to Thouvenel. Clarendon said that this despatch was entirely written
by Palmerston himself, that anybody as well acquainted with their styles as he
was must be quite certain of this, but that <i>he</i> knew it to be the case. He had
a conversation with Palmerston the other day, who praised Lord John's speech and
said it would do good, and he thought <i>the question of Savoy was in a very
satisfactory state</i>.</p>

<p>Palmerston, he told me, had said more to Flahault<a name="FNanchor_1_59" id="FNanchor_1_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_59" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> than I had been apprised
of. Flahault went to him, and found him just going to the House of Commons.
Flahault asked him to let him get into his carriage, which he did, and when
Flahault asked what he should say to the Emperor, and Palmerston told him to say
that the Emperor had better read Lord John's speech, and understand that he
(Palmerston) agreed in every word of it, Flahault said, 'Then you mean that you
have no longer any confidence in the Emperor, or place any reliance upon his
word.' Palmerston replied, 'I do mean this. After having been repeatedly
deceived and misled by his professions and assurances, it is impossible that I
can place any further confidence in him.' Then said Flahault, 'There will be
war,' to which Palmerston rejoined that he hoped not, that nobody could be more
anxious to avoid war than he was.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_59" id="Footnote_1_59"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_59"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [Count de Flahault was at this time French Ambassador in London.]</p></div>

<p>This was very spirited and becoming, and Clarendon said he highly approved of
such a tone. I said that I had all along suspected that there was a secret
understanding and collusion between Palmerston and the Emperor, and that
Palmerston had given His Majesty to understand that if he would set Italy free,
he might do what he pleased with regard to Savoy, but that what had recently
passed seemed to negative that idea. Clarendon replied he had no doubt
Palmerston had very often said to Persigny what, if repeated by Persigny to the
Emperor with some exaggerations and suppressions, would convey as much to His
Majesty, for Palmerston had a dozen times said to him (Clarendon) that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span> the
liberation and settlement of Italy was of far greater consequence than the
preservation of Savoy to Piedmont.</p>


<p><i>April 8th.</i>&mdash;To The Grove on Thursday afternoon, and returned yesterday. On
Good Friday morning George Lewis and I were left alone, when we talked over the
questions of the day, and he quite amazed me by the way in which he spoke of his
principal colleagues. I asked him if John Russell was not exceedingly mortified
at the ill-success of his Reform Bill and its reception in the House of Commons
and in the country. George Lewis said he did not think he felt this, that at
present his mind was entirely occupied with foreign politics, and he was
rejoicing in the idea of having been largely instrumental to the liberation of
Italy; and as to Reform, that he was satisfied with having redeemed the pledge
he gave to Bright to propose a 6<i>l.</i> franchise, and having done this he did not
care about the result, as he had never pledged himself to carry it. The most
strange thing to me is, that George Lewis seemed not to be alive to the culpable
levity of such conduct, or to the censure to which his own conduct is obnoxious
in consenting to act with such a man, and to be a party to such a measure.</p>

<p>With regard to Palmerston, he said that Palmerston thought of nothing but his
pro-Sardinian and anti-Austrian schemes, and he was gratified by seeing
everything in that quarter turning out according to his wishes, that in the
Cabinet he took very little part and rarely spoke. Gladstone George Lewis
evidently distrusts, and his financial schemes and arrangements are as
distasteful to him as possible. He is provoked at Gladstone's being able to bear
down all opposition, and carry all before him by the force of his eloquence and
power of words, and what I have said of his conduct in supporting John Russell
is still more applicable to it in reference to Gladstone and his measures, which
he thinks more dangerous by far than he does Lord John's Reform Bill and 6<i>l.</i>
clause. I asked him what was to be the end of this Bill, and he said he did not
expect it to pass, that probably the debates on it would be so spun out and so
many delays interposed that either it would fail in the House<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span> of Commons
itself, or even if it passed, the House of Lords would say it came up too late
for them to examine and consider it, and it would be thrown out there. I
gathered in the course of conversation that Palmerston (whose whole antecedents
and recorded opinions forbid the idea of his approving such a measure) would be
glad to see the franchise raised, and that 8<i>l.</i> and 15<i>l.</i> would in his view
improve the Bill.</p>


<div class="sidenote">MACHINATIONS OF NAPOLEON.</div>

<p><i>May 6th.</i>&mdash;Since I wrote the above, nearly a month ago, I have been out of the
way of hearing anything on public affairs, till a day or two ago when I called
on Clarendon, when he told me some things not without interest, partly about
domestic and partly about foreign affairs. The latter of course related to the
inexhaustible subject of the Emperor Napoleon's projects and machinations. His
Majesty, it seems, has recently had a conversation with M. de Moustier, French
Minister at Vienna, in the course of which he told him that it was an absolute
necessity to France to carry her frontier to the Rhine. About the same time
Cavour had signified (I forget whether it was to the same de Moustier or to some
other person) that Sardinia must obtain possession of Venetia. These
necessities, it can hardly be doubted, are expressed and resolved upon by a
common accord. Austria has been already completely crippled by the late war; if
threatened in Italy she will employ all her resources in defence of her Italian
territory, and she will be quite unable, even if she were willing, to join in
any measures of resistance to the attempts of France upon Germany. Prussia has
had the egregious folly to renew her feud with Denmark upon the affair of
Schleswig-Holstein, and is about to provoke a fresh war on that question.
Denmark thus threatened appeals to France for aid, which France is too happy to
afford, as she will thereby in all probability find a good pretext for
interference, and for the furtherance of all her designs. There seems no doubt
that a Treaty of some sort has been concluded between France and Denmark. In
this difficult and menacing posture of affairs, England will sooner or later
have to play a part of some sort, and it is disquieting enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span> to reflect upon
our diplomacy being under the charge of John Russell and of Palmerston.</p>

<p>After lingering on for several weeks with unprecedented tardiness and delay, and
a languid uninteresting discussion&mdash;debate it cannot be called&mdash;the second
reading of the Reform Bill has at last passed without opposition. The last
nights have been remarkable for the speeches hostile to the Bill of several
Liberal members, and the increasing proofs of its prodigious unpopularity.
Everybody is sick of the subject, and those who desire that some modified and
amended measure may pass, only do so because they have a horror of seeing
another Bill brought in next year, and they hope that they may now purge this
Bill of its worst and most dangerous defects, and close the subject for several
years to come. Some think that it is impossible to devise any means by which
this Bill can be made anything like safe and expedient, and would therefore
prefer to throw it out and run all chances for the future. At least one half of
the Government, with Palmerston himself at the head of the dissentients, regard
this Bill with alarm and aversion, and now that the difficulty, if not
impossibility, of passing it is obvious, they are prepared to make every sort of
sacrifice, even of its most vital provisions. Palmerston told George Lewis so,
and that John Russell himself would submit to an alteration of the franchise to
the amount of 15<i>l.</i> for the counties and 8<i>l.</i> for the towns. They know that no
question of resignation is involved in this discussion, and that whatever may be
the fate of their Bill, they will still keep their places, which no concession
will endanger, and accordingly they are ready to agree to any compromise which
will secure the Bill's passing through Parliament in any shape or way; but
notwithstanding this pliant disposition, it is very doubtful whether the Bill
can pass. It will not commence its career in Committee till the first week in
June, and it is hardly possible it can reach the House of Lords before the
middle or end of July, and the Lords may very well decline to enter on its
consideration at that late period.</p>


<div class="sidenote">CONFUSION OF PARTIES.</div>

<p><i>May 9th.</i>&mdash;A correspondence appears in the newspapers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span> between Lord Grey and
John Russell, couched in terms of no small bitterness. Such a correspondence
between men of such eminence and of the same political colour shows up to the
world the insincerity with which, for political motives at the time urgent, they
have spoken in their places in Parliament. It is no new thing that members of
the same Cabinet should often differ, and that vehemently on particular
questions, and yet when these questions come under Parliamentary discussion,
that they should exhibit to the world the semblance of an agreement and
concurrence which is remote from the truth. But though this is well understood
to be of not unfrequent occurrence, and sooner or later the details of the truth
often leak out, it is much to be regretted that men should exhibit themselves
and each other in the way which this correspondence does, for such exhibitions
cannot fail to excite suspicions of the sincerity, conscientiousness, and truth
of public men. When Governments are entirely of one party colour, either wholly
Whig or wholly Tory, and when they are presided over by some man of supereminent
authority, such differences and consequent difficulties are not likely to happen
often; but as of late years parties have been broken up, and composite
Governments have been formed, combining men of the most opposite original
principles, and imbued with very different and incompatible opinions on various
subjects, it must be continually happening that candid discussions and disputes
in the Cabinet should be followed by insincere and untruthful declarations and
argumentations in public. The understood practice from time immemorial has been,
that a dissentient from the general opinion of his colleagues upon any
<i>important</i> question must either consent to merge his own opinion in theirs, or
retire from office; and then the conduct of the dissentient was regulated by his
view of the <i>importance</i> of the matter at issue. Of course if a man were to
break off from his colleagues upon every matter of difference, however small, no
Government could possibly go on for many months or perhaps weeks, but it is
impossible in these days not to be struck with the fact that so many men are
indisposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span> to consider anything of sufficient importance to resign their
offices rather than sacrifice their enlightened consciences and mature
judgements.</p>


<p><i>May 12th.</i>&mdash;Not more than three months ago Gladstone was triumphant and
jubilant; he had taken the House of Commons and the country captive by his
eloquence, and nothing was heard everywhere but songs of praise and admiration
at his marvellous success and prodigious genius. There never was a greater
reaction in a shorter time. Everybody's voice is now against him, and his famous
Treaty and his Budget are pronounced enormous and dangerous blunders. Those who
were most captivated now seem to be most vexed and ashamed of their former
fascination. They are provoked with themselves for having been so duped, and a
feeling of resentment and bitterness against him has become widely diffused in
and out of the House of Commons, on his own side as well as on the other. It was
the operation of this feeling which caused the narrow majority on the Paper
Duties the other night, when it seems as if a little more management and
activity might have put him in a minority, and it is the same thing which is now
encouraging the House of Lords, urged on by Derby, to throw out the Resolution
when it comes before them. Derby has announced that he shall exert himself to
the utmost to procure the rejection of the Bill in the House of Lords, and if he
perseveres he will probably obtain a very unwise and perilous success, which he
will before long have to regret.</p>


<div class="sidenote">REPEAL OF THE PAPER DUTIES.</div>

<p><i>May 17th.</i>&mdash;Clarendon dined with Derby about a week ago, when Derby explained
to him all his reasons for persisting in his opposition to the Paper Duties
Bill. Clarendon said he did not talk rashly and in Rupert vein, but gave a
well-considered and well-argued statement of the grounds on which he purposed to
proceed. Clarendon evidently sympathised with him, but not without much
apprehension and doubt as to the expediency of his course. Derby appears to have
taken and to be taking prodigious pains with his case, and he said that his
object was to have a great financial debate in the Lords on the Treaty and the
Budget. Gran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>ville tells me they shall be beaten by a large majority, and he
owns that the debate will be almost all one way. There is nothing on the
Treasury Bench or behind it able to grapple with Derby, Monteagle, Overstone,
and Grey on such a question, though Granville expects Argyll to get up the
question and to speak well on it, and he expects something from Newcastle and
Ripon, but Clarendon told me (which of course he had from Lewis) the curious
fact that Palmerston himself views with pleasure the prospect of the rejection
of the Bill. A queer state of things indeed when the Prime Minister himself
secretly desires to see the defeat of a measure so precious to his own
Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>

<p>Frederick Cadogan came over from Paris the other day, and told Clarendon that
Cowley was in very bad spirits about the aspect of foreign affairs, that all
intimacy and confidence between the Emperor and him was at an end, and that it
was more and more evident that His Majesty meant to follow his own devices,
whatever they might be, without reference to anybody, or caring for the
opposition or the assent of any other Powers.</p>

<p>The Garibaldi expedition is supposed to have given great umbrage to France, but
not without some suspicions that secretly she is not sorry for it, and thinks in
its complications she may find matter to turn to her own account. Everybody
believes that Cavour has covertly connived at it, though he pretends to oppose
it. Certainly no resolute attempts were made to obstruct the expedition by the
Sardinian Government, and none whatever by France, who, if she really cared to
stop it, might easily have done so by sending ships from Toulon for the purpose.</p>

<p>Talking of Neapolitan affairs, Pahlen told me yesterday an almost incredible
anecdote, but of which he said there was no doubt of the truth. There is just
arrived a new Neapolitan Minister, Count Ludolph, grandson of the Ludolph who
was formerly here. He has replaced the former Minister, who by his own desire
was recently recalled, and he had begged for his recall because he had been
grossly insulted by Palmerston at the Queen's Drawing Room, his story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span> being
that in that room, in the Queen's presence (who was of course out of hearing),
Palmerston had attacked him on the proceedings of his Government and the conduct
of the King, telling him that a revolution would probably be the consequence
thereof, which would be nothing more than they deserved, and which would be seen
in this country with universal satisfaction. The man was so flabbergasted by
this unexpected and monstrous sortie that he had not presence of mind to make a
suitable answer, and to <i>riposter</i> with the spirit which the occasion required
of him. I must endeavour to find out if this is true. Palmerston has always been
noted for the vivacity and often acerbity of his language in despatches, but in
oral communications and in speeches he has never been reproached with
intemperance or incivility, but, on the contrary, has always evinced
self-control and gentlemanlike and polite behaviour and language.</p>


<p><i>May 28th.</i>&mdash;Epsom engaged all my attention last week, and I could not find time
to notice the debate in the Lords on the Paper Duties, and the extraordinary
majority, so much greater than anybody expected. Lyndhurst undertook to speak on
the constitutional part of the question, and got leave to speak early (between
Granville and Monteagle) that he might go home to celebrate his birthday, which
fell on that day, when he completed his eighty-eighth year. He made a very good
speech, and met with an enthusiastic reception. Lady Palmerston was in the
gallery, openly expressing her wishes that the Bill might be rejected by a large
majority. Her language on this and other occasions so shocked some of the more
zealous Whigs, that the Duke of Bedford was asked by one or more of them to
remonstrate with her on the way she talked, but she knows very well that
Palmerston is of the same mind, though he cannot avow his real sentiments in the
way she does. Palmerston said to Gladstone, 'Of course you are mortified and
disappointed, but your disappointment is nothing to mine, who had a horse with
whom I hoped to win the Derby, and he went amiss at the last moment.' The affair
has gone off very quietly, the House of Commons not being the least dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>posed to
quarrel with the Lords about it. Even John Russell, who had talked very
absurdly, held moderate and prudent language in the House.<a name="FNanchor_1_60" id="FNanchor_1_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_60" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_60" id="Footnote_1_60"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_60"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [A Bill for abolishing the duty on paper was carried in the House of
Commons on March 12 by a majority of 245 to 192. It was rejected on May 21 by
the House of Lords by a majority of 193 to 104. The dispute was eventually
settled by a resolution for removing so much of the duty on paper as exceeded
the Excise duty at home.]</p></div>



<div class="sidenote">REFORM BILL WITHDRAWN.</div>

<p><i>June 15th.</i>&mdash;At Ascot last week. Palmerston was there, and went up to town on
Thursday (going reluctantly) to assist at the withdrawal by John Russell of the
Reform Bill. There was a Cabinet the preceding day, at which Palmerston said,
'We must now settle what is to be done about the Reform Bill.' John Russell
said, 'I know what my opinion is, and if anybody wishes to hear it I am ready to
give it.' They all said they did wish it, when he announced that he thought it
ought to be withdrawn. Everybody agreed except Gladstone, who made a long speech
in favour of going on with it, which nobody replied to, and there it ended. A
discussion took place as to what should be said, and strong opinions expressed
that nothing but moderate language should be employed, which John Russell agreed
to, and he acted up to it by making a very becoming speech, which would have
been faultless if he had not announced another Reform Bill on the earliest
possible occasion. This, too, he did entirely off his own bat, and without any
consultation or agreement with his colleagues. Fortunately these announcements
are no longer so important or so binding as heretofore, and I think it probable,
unless there is some great change in public opinion (which is not likely), that
when the time draws near Palmerston and a majority of the Cabinet will not
consent to a fresh attempt.</p>


<p><i>July 8th.</i>&mdash;I have been so ill till within the last few days that I have not
had energy enough to do anything. I have known but little, and that little I
could not bring myself to write down here. In fact, it is high time that I
should close these records once for all, which I am morally and physically
incapable of continuing with any probability of making them interesting. It is
not very consistent with this opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span> to fill a page or two with the recent
transaction in the House of Commons, with reference to the duty on paper.
Everybody allows that Palmerston got out of his difficulty with consummate tact
and discretion, and that Gladstone's conduct was inexcusable. The Resolutions
concocted by Palmerston had been fully discussed and agreed to in the Cabinet
(reluctantly of course by Gladstone), and Palmerston's speech was received with
general approbation in the House. It was excellent, fair and moderate, the
argument logically consistent with the Resolutions, but displeasing to Gladstone
and the highflyers because it made a sort of excuse for the Lords, or rather it
set forth the grounds on which the Lords might think themselves justified in
acting as they did, without having any of the motives and designs which the
Gladstones and Brights attributed to them. All this elicited great applause from
the Opposition side of the House, and their cheers were very offensive to and
grated on the ears of the ultra-Liberals. Everything would have ended quietly,
and the Resolutions would have passed without a debate, but Gladstone could not
stand it, and, urged by spite and mortification, he must needs get up and make a
most violent speech, really, though not avowedly, in opposition to Palmerston,
and with the object of provoking a long and acrimonious debate. In this he only
partially succeeded, and not for long. The debate lasted one night more, but
nothing could be made of the Amendments. Palmerston kept his temper and
displayed great firmness and resolution. The House was with him. Bright, partly
from being very unwell, and probably partly from some discretion, made a
moderate speech; everybody seemed determined to bring the matter to an end, and
the Resolutions were very triumphantly carried. Granville told me yesterday
morning that it was a toss up whether Gladstone resigned or not, and that if he
did, it would break up the Liberal party, to which I replied that I was
confident he would not resign, and if he did, it would have no effect on the
bulk of the Liberal party.</p>


<div class="sidenote">RADICAL ELEMENT IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.</div>

<p><i>July 17th.</i>&mdash;I met Charles Villiers at dinner at the Travellers' last night and
had some talk with him, parti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>cularly about Gladstone. He thinks it far better
that he should not resign, as he could, and probably would, be very mischievous
out of office. He says people do not know the House of Commons, and are little
aware that there is an obscure but important element in it of a Radical
complexion, and that there are sixty or seventy people who would constitute
themselves followers of Gladstone, and urge him on to every sort of mischief.
They are already doing all they can to flatter and cajole him, and once out of
office, his great talents and oratorical powers would make him courted by all
parties, even the Tories, who would each and all be very glad to enlist him in
their service. It is impossible to calculate on the course of a man so variable
and impulsive, but at present it looks as if he had made up his mind to swallow
his mortifications and disappointments and to go on with his present colleagues,
though Charles Villiers says he is very dejected and uneasy in his mind, and
very gloomy in the Cabinet.</p>

<p>I asked him if he had seen Senior's last Journals, relating his visit to Paris,
which he had not. I told him they were very interesting, and that all his
interlocutors, however varying in opinions upon other subjects, were agreed as
to the certainty of the Emperor's meditating fresh wars and aggressions, and
sooner or later a war with us. He said he thought it probable that any attempt
on Belgium would be deferred till after King Leopold's death (who is
seventy-five years old), at which time in all probability the annexation would
be attempted, and with very reasonable prospects of being assented to by the
Belgians themselves, an idea which had not struck me, but which I think
exceedingly likely.</p>


<p><i>Buxton, August 11th.</i>&mdash;I came here for my health and to try and patch myself up
a fortnight ago, since which I have heard and learnt nothing of what is passing
in the world but what I read in the newspapers. The session of Parliament was
drawing to a close, and it was understood that there was to be one more fight in
the House of Commons (on the removal of the Customs duties on paper), and then
the remaining business was to be hurried through as quickly as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span> possible. The
Opposition made strenuous efforts to obtain a majority, and were sanguine of
success. The Speaker wrote me an account of what passed, and I shall copy out
the greatest part of his letter. 'The division of thirty-three on the Paper
Duties was a surprise to all on the spot. As late as eleven that evening Sir
George Grey told us the division seemed very doubtful. The Irishmen held off
indignant at Palmerston's having mentioned with approval the landing of
Garibaldi on the mainland. This was held to be an insult to the Pope, so More
O'Farrell, Monsell, Sir John Acton, and eight or ten more would not vote at all.
It seemed doubtful to the last. It is a great thing for the Government in many
ways, not the least in having won the battle without the Pope and his men. It
puts the Government in so much better and stronger a position with that party.
The great result is to give some life to half-dead, broken-down, tempest-tossed
Gladstone. When after the division he rose to propose the second Resolution, he
was cheered by the Free-traders as he had not been cheered since the Budget
Speech. Colonel Taylor tells me they had been led to success by promises from
two quarters. First the paper-makers and the "Times" engaged to bring fifty men
to the post, and only brought five. The Irishmen promised to be twenty-five, but
were only eleven, the others standing off and not voting. I have a long letter
from Cobden, angry about fortifications and Volunteers.' This morning I received
another letter from the Speaker, enclosing Cobden's, which he has sent me to
read. He says, 'It is written in rather a spirit of exaggeration, but it is the
fault of Cobden's mind to see one object so strongly, that his view cannot
embrace another at the same time.' Cobden's is well written, and contains much
that is true, but he has evidently been so cajoled and flattered at Paris that
he is now completely bamboozled, and so credulous that he takes for gospel all
the Emperor says, and complains bitterly of 'all that is going on at home' and
especially of the tone of Palmerston's and Sidney Herbert's speeches.
'Believing,' he says, 'that the new French tariff will realise a complete
revolution in the commercial relations of the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span> countries, and having taken
pains to impress this opinion on the Government, I am amazed at the course they
are taking. The language of Palmerston and Sidney Herbert, coupled with the
fortification scheme (he says), cuts the ground, on which I urged the Emperor to
enter on the Free Trade policy, from under my feet. Nine tenths of his motives
for making the plunge into that policy now were political rather than
politico-economical; he aimed at conciliating the English people, and I did not
hesitate to assure him that if he entered without reserve on the Free Trade
path, it would be taken as a proof of his pacific intentions by the British
public.'</p>


<div class="sidenote">CONCLUSION OF THESE JOURNALS.</div>

<p><i>London, November 13th.</i>&mdash;At the end of three months since I last wrote anything
in this book, I take my pen in hand to record my determination to bring this
journal (which is no journal at all) to an end. I have long seen that it is
useless to attempt to carry it on, for I am entirely out of the way of hearing
anything of the slightest interest beyond what is known to all the world. I
therefore close this record without any intention or expectation of renewing it,
with a full consciousness of the smallness of its value or interest, and with
great regret that I did not make better use of the opportunities I have had of
recording something more worth reading.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
